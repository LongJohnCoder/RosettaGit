# Contributing to RosettaGit

Thanks a lot for taking the time to contribute!


## Activate a Draft

Tasks which still contain formatting issues, incorrect code,
conceptual problems, or other severe issues are listed at
[rosettagit.org/drafts].

To activate it, first clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ad-si/RosettaGit.git
```

Then open it with your favorite text editor and go through
the draft file you want to activate.
You should fix any formatting issues and other obvious problems you encounter.
Once your happy (it doesn't need to be perfect,
just not obviously broken anymore) you can move the file from
`content/drafts` to `content/tasks`, commit it,
and finally open a merge request.

Check out one of the existing tasks at [rosettagit.org/tasks]
if you're unsure how the files should be formatted.

## Add a New Task

Before trying to add a new task, please make sure that there is
not already a draft for it at [rosettagit.org/drafts].

If there isn't, simply add a new file for your task to `content/tasks`,
create its content similar to [existing tasks][rosettagit.org/tasks]
commit it, and finally open a merge request.
