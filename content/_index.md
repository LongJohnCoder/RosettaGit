RosettaGit is a programming [chrestomathy] site.
The idea is to present solutions to the same task
in as many different programming languages as possible.
It demonstrates how languages are similar and different
and can help you learn new approaches to solving problems.

RosettaGit currently has **{{number_of_tasks}} tasks**,
**{{number_of_drafts}} drafts**,
and features **{{number_of_langs}} languages**.

The ultimate goal is to have solutions to every task in every language.

The data was originally forked from [rosettacode.org] on 2019-10-22.

In comparison to Rosetta Code all code is stored and hosted
in a [repository on GitHub][rosettagit].

For a detailed explanation and log of this fork,
please check out my launch blog post at
[repository on GitHub][rosettagit].
