PureScript is a strongly-typed, purely-functional programming language
that compiles to JavaScript.
It can be used to develop web applications, server side apps,
and also desktop applications with use of Electron.
Its syntax is mostly comparable to that of Haskell.
In addition, it introduces row polymorphism and extensible records.
Also, contrary to Haskell, PureScript adheres to a strict evaluation strategy.
