Nim (formerly known as Nimrod) is a general purpose,
high-level, system programming,
statically typed imperative compiled programming language
that is developed by Andreas Rumpf.

There is a lot of focus on portability and efficiency.
The language compiles to C, C++ and JavaScript.
Nim is actively being developed.
The language has extensive
[documentation](https://nim-lang.org/documentation.html),
and a very good [tutorial](https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut1.html).

You can ask for help in the chat on Freenode in the #nim channel,
