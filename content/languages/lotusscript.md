LotusScript is a programming language used in Lotus Notes
and other IBM Lotus products.
It is very similar to [Visual Basic](/languages/visual_basic)
(code can usually be copied between languages with little modification),
but has many specific built-in classes
for accessing objects within the Lotus Notes/Domino environment.

The Lotus Domino Designer application is the primary IDE
used for developing programs in LotusScript,
and also allows development in [Java]/[JavaScript] and Formula language.
