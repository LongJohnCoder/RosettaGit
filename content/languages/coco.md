{{language}}

'''Coco''' is a variant of [[CoffeeScript]], and thus an alternative syntax for [[JavaScript]]. Like [[MoonScript]], it generally errs on the side of including more features, as opposed to the partly minimalist philosophy of CoffeeScript.

It is described on [https://github.com/satyr/coco GitHub] (where all the documentation currently resides) as being designed according to the following principles:

* Respect JS semantics and idioms.
* Die for DRY.
* [[Perl]] over [[Ruby]].
* Fewer keywords, punctuations and runtime errors.
