I think it would be a good idea to add another task in the same manner as this one, but the task would require a much more robust algorithm, supporting (among other things), signed 
numbers) and most important of all, numbers with (decimal or other bases) fractions. 

The task could be to show pi and e (both having, say, 70 digits at least) expressed in binary, hexadecimal and (say), base 62  (with lower- and uppercase alphabetic characters supported in addition to the usual numerals). 

Also, showing some common fractions (1/3, 1/7) in various bases would be interesting. 

Also, for extra credit, support extremely large bases, say (1k, 10k, 1g, etc).   

Using glyphs is out of the question, but the "digits" (as I have already coded a REXX program) are bracketed "digits", such as [147][23] 

which for base 1g, would be 147,000,000,023 in base 10.

(The brackets can be user-specified.)

Also supported could be a special base {-26} where A=1, B=2, ... Z=26 --- for interest by certain game enthusiasts and/or amateur cyptogrammers.) --- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]]

== Scratch contribution ==

Hi,

I'm a 12 years old boy, and I'd like to contribute to this page, by adding the Scratch solution to this problem.

The program is at: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26501854/

I actually need help because I know very little about this site.

Thank you
