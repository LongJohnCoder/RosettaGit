==Combine with Lucas-Lehmer_test?==
This is essentially just going to be a duplicate of [[Lucas-Lehmer_test]], or perhaps [[Factors_of_a_Mersenne_number]]. Probably best off combining the pages and making this page redirect to one of those.


I'd prefer to have AppleScript correctly implemented for one of those more precisely like the Lucas Lehmer test before it gets merged.
