Rosetta Code isn't the only project which aims to document tasks in multiple languages.  Other projects do exist.  Here's a list. Feel free to update and add to it.

These sites were online at one point, but have since vanished with no forwarding address. If you know of online, existing archived copies, please link to them. Also, Rosetta Code may be interested in hosting static copies of such sites where they're at risk of disappearing. Having such content disappear is counter to the goals of this site.

If a site is listed in this section, but is actually still live, please move it back to the live section.

It's gone...

The Internet Archive crawled the site 3 times in April of 2008. http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.nocruft.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page 
Unfortunately there doesn't seem to have been much content on the site at the time.
