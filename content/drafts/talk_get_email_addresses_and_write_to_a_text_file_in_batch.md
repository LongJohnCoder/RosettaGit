==Vote for deletion.==
It is counter-productive to require the task be written in a specific language when the whole point of a chrestomathy site is to write solutions to the same task in many different languages. Sounds like a homework question (not necessarily a bad thing but still...). The task is poorly specified. As it stands, I vote for deletion. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 17:39, 24 May 2017 (UTC)
: +1 for deletion.  Does not sound like homework to me but rather desire to be a script kiddie spammer or hacker but lacking knowledge of any sources of scripts.  I would not only delete but ban the submitter.  Or, we could modify the task to not say batch, then we could continue with tasks like "Zero day", "Escalation of privilege", "Ransomware", "Brick phone", "Smoke USB"... --[[User:Sonia|Sonia]] ([[User talk:Sonia|talk]]) 17:58, 24 May 2017 (UTC)
