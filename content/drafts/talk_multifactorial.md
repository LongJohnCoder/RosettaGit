### positive integers


I would hope that the definition would be extended to all non-negative integers, not just the positive integers. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] 00:29, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

:It probably could be so extended, but I just wanted something that fit the mathworld and OEIS definition. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 01:47, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

:: MathWorld, in fact, gives the wrong values when it referenced (quotes) the integer sequences from the OEIS values;   it omits the first value   (of the zero<sup>th</sup> entry)   for each definition example.   OEIS does, in fact, define all the multifactorial sequences as starting with zero.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]])

==Formulae made invisible by under-tested cosmetic edits at 08:59, 9 May 2016 ==

Under-tested cosmetic edits made to the task page at 08:59, 9 May 2016, including the injection of spaces around expressions in &lt;math&gt; tags, have left the task description formulae completely invisible to all browsers which display the graphic file version of formulae rather than processing the MathML (this is, in fact, the majority of browsers). The MediaWiki processor does not currently expect such spaces, and generates syntactically ill-formed HTML if they are introduced. Other aspects of these cosmetic edits may further compound the problem. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 11:42, 24 September 2016 (UTC)
