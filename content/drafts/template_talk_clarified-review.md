Perhaps this template should include support for a date when the task was clarified, or a list of the implementations that need review (though this raises other issues), or a summary of the nature of the changes?

When I find this template on a page, I do not know when the task was clarified, nor do I really know what points were clarified, so unless I am deeply interested and willing to carefully study the page's history, the presence of this template does not carry any information for me.
