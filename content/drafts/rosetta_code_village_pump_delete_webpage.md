Is there way of deleting spam webpages even though I am not an admin/bureaucrat?
:You can replace their contents with {{tmpl|remove}}. That'll get rid of the links and put the page in a category of pages that should be deleted. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] ([[User talk:Mwn3d|talk]]) 14:08, 16 July 2015 (UTC)
