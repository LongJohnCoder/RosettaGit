==Linkage==

I noticed the existence of this page by accident when I had a quick glance at the "recent changes". I don't think a link to it exists anywhere on the internet (in particular google (through the search box on the left) doesn't know about it. Can/should/ought there be a mechanism to generate a list of links to Village_Pump:Home/somethingsomething in some kind of automagic fashion?[[User:Sgeier|Sgeier]] 17:44, 10 July 2008 (UTC)
:I'm not quite sure what you mean. There is a link to [[Village Pump:Home]] in the sidebar. There should have been a link on that page for this topic, but I guess we forgot about it. Also, the google search on the left isn't updated very often. It's only marginally better than the default wiki search. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 17:53, 10 July 2008 (UTC)
:: There's no link to this page from the main Village Pump page. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 04:39, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
