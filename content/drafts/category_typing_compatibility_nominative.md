{{feature|Typing/Compatibility}}
In this typing scheme, a type has a name and two “type instances” with the same structure but different names are different types.
This is more restrictive than [[:Category:Typing/Compatibility/Structural|structural typing]], in that it can distinguish types that are structurally identical.
