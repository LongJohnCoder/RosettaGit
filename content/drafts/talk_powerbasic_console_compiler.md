I hope someone who actually uses PB/CC joins RC soon... I only know ''about'' it, I don't actually have a copy... -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 15:58, 28 August 2009 (UTC)
: Send them an email.  It's what I do when I have the time. :) --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 19:48, 28 August 2009 (UTC)
:: "Them" who? PB/CC users? Or PowerBASIC Inc.? The former are probably somewhat rare, while the latter are... uh... -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 19:57, 28 August 2009 (UTC)
::: Normally, it means putting the request somewhere where the usage community would see it.  They apparently have [http://www.powerbasic.com/support/pbforums/ forums]. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 04:23, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

Is this an implementation of PB, or a tool that's used with it? If it's the former, can someone tag the page with the {{tmpl|implementation}} template? Ta! –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 14:56, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
:Implementation. It never occurred to me, sorry. Fixed. Ditto [[PB/Win]] and [[PB/DOS]]. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 15:01, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
:: Excellent! (I always find this sort of thing is good filler to bulk up what would be otherwise a very short stub page… ;-)) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 15:03, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
::: Interestingly, I just now looked at the history, and [[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] had marked it as an implementation at one point, and I removed it for reasons which I no longer remember. Sorry, Ian, you were right, and I'm an idiot. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 05:04, 28 December 2010 (UTC)
