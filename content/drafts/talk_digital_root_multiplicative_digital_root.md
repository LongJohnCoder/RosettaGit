The second task "tabulate MP versus the first five numbers having that MP" is inconsistent with the sample output.  Assuming the output values are correct, the task should say "tabulate MDR versus the first five numbers having that MDR", and the "MD" column in the output should be "MDR". --Globules 06:00:08, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

: I've fixed that. Values with an MP of 9 seem to be rather large (I stopped looking at 20000000). --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 08:39, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

I've promoted this to a task. It's got a clear description, and it's got more than 4 implementations in different languages. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 15:58, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
