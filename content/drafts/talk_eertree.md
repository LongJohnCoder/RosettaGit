==suffix tries==
<strike>
The reference   (in the 2<sup>nd</sup> sentence in the task's preamble)   to (possibly) a Rosetta Code task   '''suffix tries'''   seems to be a dead link, or it may be misspelled.   Could someone fix this?   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 04:59, 13 October 2017 (UTC)
