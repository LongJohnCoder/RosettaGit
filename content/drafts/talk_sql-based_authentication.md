The python version does not do the right thing with the salt. The password's 16 first bytes are used as salt,
readable by everyone in clear with DB access !

== Howto retrieve code from old revision without reverting? ==

Looking at history, I've found the python code, which beyond the comment in this page, it seems reasonable (at most, can be flagged for improvements or fixes); but there are 22 revisions or so between current and the one with the add of the python code. So, how can be rescued a code from a previous revision, without reverting the page at that revision? Can be done easily, or we have to extract the info from the diff? --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 09:21, 6 August 2010 (UTC)
: You should be able to click "undo" next to that page, and it should undo just those changes, if it can. Otherwise, copy and paste. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 13:21, 6 August 2010 (UTC)
