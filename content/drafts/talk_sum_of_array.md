Is this task intended to be computing the sum of an ''array'', or the language's usual sequence data structure? I ask because the Erlang, Prolog, and Haskell examples use linked lists instead. Haskell, for example, has arrays but using them is less common; I don't know about Erlang and Prolog. (If it were up to me, I'd move and redescribe the task to be computing the sum of a sequence of numbers.) --[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 10:20, 28 March 2007 (EDT)

== Merge Sum and Product? ==

This is similar enough to [[Product of Array]] that I think the tasks should be merged. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 10:16, 20 October 2007 (MDT)
