What features are sufficient for a piece of software to be a "gateway"?  --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 21:59, 5 May 2011 (UTC)

: The says "Create an IRC Gateway capable of connecting an IRC server with another IRC server". I think that IRC servers are already capable of connecting to other IRC servers. [[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 10:12, 24 July 2011 (UTC)

: You cannot connect two IRC servers if they belong to different networks (like Freenode or OFTC). An IRC gateway is a bot that joins two channels on different servers. The bot listens to each channel, and relays everything to the other channel. Some years ago, I met a gateway between two IRC channels. I believe that such gateways are rare, because most communities would agree to one server or network. A gateway that spans two different protocols (like IRC to Jabber/XMPP) would be more useful, but would need to know a second protocol. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 15:47, 24 July 2011 (UTC)
::Right I know what you mean. There used to be an excellent one in #witches on all of the major networks. [[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 16:25, 24 July 2011 (UTC)
