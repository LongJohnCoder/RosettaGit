When you say "wrap" for ^ do you mean "warp"? Can you show an example of what should happen? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 23:10, 4 June 2008 (MDT)
:Yes, it is ''warp'' not ''wrap'', I mixed these two words, sorry. Example : 
::<code>==a^A<=cp==B^==<=C^==</code>
:when the code pointer cp heading into A's^, next turn, the code pointer will be in C. if no such ^ in the reverse direction, the code pointer will be in ''a'' next turn.
:Thanks for reminding, i've fixed the article text. [[User:Badmadevil|badmadevil]] 02:15, 5 June 2008 (MDT)
