Should these get their own RC pages? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:53, 6 April 2008 (MDT)
: Yes. Examples of how they should be set up can be found, for example, in [[:Category:C++ Implementations]] I've got a presentation in front of the Grand Rapids Python Users' Group today; Maybe I can throw it at them. :) (Hello, there! See me prepping for a same-day presentation? :) ) --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 16:38, 17 May 2010 (UTC)
