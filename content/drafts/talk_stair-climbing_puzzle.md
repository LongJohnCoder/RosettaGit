==Problem statement==
The problem is ambiguous as stated. It says to climb one step up, not climb up one step up from the starting position. Thus the original C# code that was there solved the 'climb one step up'. <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding unsigned comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.59.209.100|71.59.209.100]]</span>
