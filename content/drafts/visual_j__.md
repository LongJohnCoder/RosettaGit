'''Visual J++''' is [[Microsoft]]'s implementation of [[Java]]. Microsoft's policy of [[wp:Embrace, extend and extinguish|"embrace, extend and extinguish"]] was applied during the creation of Visual J++, with the end result being a Java executable that might not run on the standard Sun Java runtime if certain MS features were used. (For more information, see [[wp:Visual J++#J++ compared to Sun's Java implementation|J++ compared to Sun's Java implementation]] and [[wp:Visual J++#Sun's litigation against Microsoft|Sun's litigation against Microsoft]].)
