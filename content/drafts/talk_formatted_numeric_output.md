==Poorly named?==
I was expecting this page to be about initializing memory, like C's memset(addr, 0, len);

Perhaps a better page name for formatted numeric output? --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 13:31, 29 May 2007 (EDT)

I agree with the above completely, so I've renamed it. --[[User:crc|Charles Childers]] 9 June 2007

== What to display? ==
Some implementations only display the single number "00007.125" as specified in the task description.
Others display many different format options. Which one should it be?

: I suppose that "Express a number in decimal as a fixed-length string with leading zeros" is the guide, so it is enough to show "007.125" (i.e. show how to specify a fixed-length output string and the fact that leading zeros must fill the room) --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 15:08, 2 April 2009 (UTC)
