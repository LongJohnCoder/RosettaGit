What is the purpose of this page? â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:53, 24 May 2010 (UTC)
: See [[Rosetta Code talk:Village Pump/Javascript Functionality Add]], though this page should probably have gone in the Rosetta Code namespace. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 12:35, 24 May 2010 (UTC)

: Just moved it.  Will be changing links on [[Rosetta Code talk:Village Pump/Javascript Functionality Add]] shortly.  --[[User:Tyrok1|Tyrok1]] 03:16, 25 May 2010 (UTC)
