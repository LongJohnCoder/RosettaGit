== F sharp vs F Sharp ==

Categories don't work as redirects.  There are currently 54 solutions under [[:Category:F Sharp]] and 16 under [[:Category:F sharp]].

Perhaps this would be less error prone if we made the {header} template do a special-case replace of "#" with the preferred capitalization of " sharp" instead of having a second optional parameter?  Bonus: this would also catch the [[C sharp|C#]] special case.  I don't think we use that second parameter for any other languages. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 17:08, 18 February 2010 (UTC)
:I'm bumping this. We need to figure this out. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 03:41, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
::I suggest to remove this category page. As Ian already noted, redirecting a category page won't put the pages into the new category. Thus I think it's better to get a red link (i.e. a link to a non-existing page) which would be a sign that there is something wrong. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 21:34, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
