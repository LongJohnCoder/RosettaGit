I really like the look of this. Do you guys think it's ready to use instead of the language template? Does it need to change at all? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:35, 12 May 2011 (UTC)
: It's a little heavy for my taste with all those dark areas. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 09:57, 13 May 2011 (UTC)
::Would it help if the property names ("Execution method", "Type safety", etc.) weren't in dark gray boxes? It would be just as well if those were white because I just checked in IE7 (at work) and "darkgrey" doesn't seem to register as a color in that table. Would it help if any of the darker areas were lightened? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 13:29, 13 May 2011 (UTC)
: It doesn't show well on a CRT. I'd take a screenshot, but... (If I'd brought my camera in, I could show it reasonably well). I'd suggest setting the left column's td cells' top and left borders to darkgray, bottom and right borders to white, and background to lightgray. And the right column's td cells' top border to darkgray, no left border, with the right and bottom to white, and keep the background at lightgray. Then I'd get rid of all spacing between the columns (but not the rows). That should give you a clean stepped-button look similar to the logo's, with the background color comfortably light. Finally, I'd either set font-weight to bold for all cells in both columns, Using increased text size for column headers if necessary, or I'd bump of the font size slightly. (i.e. 90% instead of 75%). The column separation is nice, but with a mainly-monochromatic theme the links in the left column aren't easily visible against the darkgray backdrop. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:49, 13 May 2011 (UTC)
::I made the text bigger and made sure the bolding worked correctly. I'll have to figure out the borders and spacing in {{tmpl|Language/Property/Generic}}. I'll have to bone up on table formatting again. Are the changes OK so far? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:53, 13 May 2011 (UTC)
::: More readable than it was, though the bulleted items are still non-bold. Keep up the good work. :) --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 19:17, 13 May 2011 (UTC)
