{{feature|Programming paradigm}}'''Procedural programming''' describes a way of decomposing a programming problem, when a larger problem is decomposed into smaller ones by means of subprograms. This type of decomposition is called ''procedural''. It is typical for [[imperative programming]] and functional programming paradigms.

In [[object-oriented programming]] procedural decomposition plays a subordinate role. Subprograms become methods of objects, which replace the former as building blocks.

Historically, procedural programming played a decisive role in the creation of programming solutions to engineering problems.
