==Maths equations fail in Firefox==
I am seeing a lot of errors around the maths equations of the task description. I am using Firefox 56.0.2 (32 bit) on Windows.

: Are they failing in and around the   <big> ''d<sub>j</sub>'' = <big><big><big>{</big></big></big> ... </big> ?       If so, look (via edit) at the   ''commented out''   (not normally visible)   HTML code   ''within''   the Rosetta Code task   [[Leonardo numbers]]   preamble, which (on my FireFox and IE Explorer web browsers) causes Rosetta Code to fail to render the equation correctly, in fact, it causes Rosetta Code to get a "time out".   The HTML code that is commented out works correctly on Wikipedia, where the HTML code was originally copied from     (<u>exactly</u> copied).   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 18:01, 6 November 2017 (UTC)

:: This sounds like a firefox regression.
:: I've been seeing a lot of regressions "lately" (actually, the last three or four years ... maybe - it's hard to put strict boundaries on this kind of thing), in browsers and in OSes. I do not know how to address such systematic failures. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 18:38, 6 November 2017 (UTC)

::: In my case, the FireFox that I run hasn't been updated (on my computer) for over three years now.   So, ... no regression here.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:42, 6 November 2017 (UTC)^

:::: Let me explain a little further.   When I use the original Leonardo HTML text   (that fails),   and then I see the failure(s) in parsing the HTML code,   I then use (open)   ''another''   Firefox session, I try to access the '''Rosetta Code''' site   (https://rosettacode.org),   Firefox comes back (eventually) and tells me that   ''the Rosetta Code site is down or is busy, try again later''.     I concluded that the Rosetta Code site is busy or stuck trying to complete and/or process the failing process and I also concluded that Rosetta Code is failing for all other requests/processes for all other Rosetta Code users during this time   ---   until I close the (Firefox) window that contains the error message(s).     -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 02:58, 30 July 2019 (UTC)
