{{property}}This describes all capabilities which, while not directly provided by a language or its standard library, is still accessible from the language through third-party libraries, or can easily be emulated from within the language. Features which are directly provided by the language or corresponding standard library should use [[:Property:provides]] instead. For libraries providing a capability, also [[:Property:provides]] should be used.
