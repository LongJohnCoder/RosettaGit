'''Protel''' stands for "Procedure Oriented Type Enforcing Language". It is a programming language created by [[wp:Nortel Networks|Nortel Networks]] and used on telecommunications switching systems such as the [[wp:DMS-100|DMS-100]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Krishna|first=Sundeep Sahay, Brian Nicholson, S.|title=Global IT outsourcing : software development across borders|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521816045|page=7}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | journal = Telesis | issue = 3 | year = 1989 }}</ref> Protel-2 is the object-oriented version of Protel.<ref name=IEEE>[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802525 “Experience with a modular typed language: PROTEL”], ICSE '81 Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Software engineering

PROTEL languages were designed to meet the needs of digital telephony and is the basis of the [[wp:DMS-100|DMS-100]] line of switching systems  PROTEL is a strongly-typed, block-structured language which is based heavily on [[Pascal|PASCAL]] and [[ALGOL 68]] with [[wp:reverse polish notation|reverse polish notation]] style of variable assignment.  The designers of PROTEL significantly extended PASCAL of the day by adding external compilation and extending the data structures available in the language.<ref name=IEEE/>
