Considering their size, I'm thinking the code examples should be moved to the task pages where they fit in. '''Hello World''' belongs under [[User Output]], Off-hand, I don't know which prime number algorithm task the '''Prime Numbers''' example belongs under, but '''Socket Client''' looks like it belongs under [[HTTP Request]]. I'm not generally against code examples on language pages, but if we go that route I'd prefer them to be short and sweet, perhaps syntactic or a small-code, size-efficient demonstration of functionality--bulk code is what the task pages are for. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 03:25, 17 May 2010 (UTC)
:The prime numbers example looks like it goes in [[Primality by trial division]] based on the existence of "trialDivisor" as a variable. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 03:33, 17 May 2010 (UTC)
