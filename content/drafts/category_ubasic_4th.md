'''uBasic''' (not to be confused with [[UBASIC]]) is an integer Basic interpreter in the tradition of Tiny BASIC, with which it is largely compatible. This version is entirely written in [[4tH]], some bugs have been removed and several additional features have been added, like user stack support and structured programming:

*<tt>PUSH, POP()</tt> and <tt>TOS()</tt> can be used to emulate <tt>DATA</tt> statements, pass parameters to subroutines or make recursive subroutines;
*<tt>DO, LOOP, UNTIL, WHILE, CONTINUE</tt> and <tt>BREAK</tt> supported;
*Multi line <tt>IF..THEN..ELSE..ENDIF</tt> supported;
*Parameter passing supported by <tt>GOSUB</tt>, <tt>RETURN</tt> and <tt>FUNC()</tt> extensions;
*Local variables supported, both initialized and uninitialized;
*Alphanumeric labels supported;
*"Structured Basic" commenting style.
