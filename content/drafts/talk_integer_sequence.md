== Criteria for non-draft? ==

What are the criteria for this being a non-draft task? My usual rule-of-thumbs are all satisfied (multiple correct implementations by multiple people, so it appears to be entirely understandable and practical). â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 00:45, 17 February 2011 (UTC)
: I've been satisfied with it for a while, just waiting for people to bring up any issues they had. Converted to non-draft. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 01:27, 17 February 2011 (UTC)
: I just added a recommendation for showing both native and arbitrarily-large numbers where appropriate, and soliciting discussion of the state of such in the language. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 01:35, 17 February 2011 (UTC)
