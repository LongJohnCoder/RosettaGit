==task clarification==

I assume the task is to implement a computer program to 

::*   simulate playing the 15-game (puzzle)
::*   generate a random start position
::*   prompt the user for which piece to move
::*   validate if the move is legal (possible)
::*   display the game (puzzle) as pieces are moved
::*   announce when the puzzle is solved
::*   possibly keep track of the number of moves 



Should the initial (random) puzzle position be a winnable puzzle?   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 07:30, 10 April 2016 (UTC)

: Yes. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 12:46, 10 April 2016 (UTC)

==Javascript query==
When you complete the javascript game, the alert shows without the last move updated. Is there a way to update the screen before the alert? [[User:Petelomax|Pete Lomax]] ([[User talk:Petelomax|talk]]) 17:12, 12 December 2017 (UTC)
: Sure, though fixing that here won't fix the off-site implementation. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 17:33, 12 December 2017 (UTC)
:: Excellent, thanks. [[User:Petelomax|Pete Lomax]] ([[User talk:Petelomax|talk]]) 18:14, 12 December 2017 (UTC)

== Vote to remove "code golf" example. ==

Can [[15_Puzzle_Game#C89.2C_22_lines_version]] be removed?

This site isn't about code golf, it's about presenting readable, comparable, useful examples of solving tasks in various languages.
The linked example is not readable, comparable, or useful in my opinion and should just be removed.

:+1 on that! It's not RC. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 07:57, 22 June 2018 (UTC)
