If someone can dig up a better list of MS-specific "extensions" used in JScript, it might be handy to post a link. Something like '''<nowiki>[http://msdn/.../whatever.aspx list of differences between JScript and JavaScript]</nowiki>'''. I found a very short list on Wikipedia, but knowing MS, that can't be ''nearly'' all of them.

...and on that note, could someone rephrase what I wrote re: that link? It doesn't look quite right, but I can't think of a better way to phrase it. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 20:52, 7 October 2009 (UTC)
