Sorry, i wrote it wrong.
I said that it's not using lang tags, and more than half of examples are outdated. --[[Special:Contributions/201.67.215.34|201.67.215.34]] 19:31, 10 April 2009 (UTC) (Guga360)

I will turn it in some clearer reusable function some day... --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 00:20, 14 December 2008 (UTC)

==Clarification==
This task could really stand some normalization.  The task description is really vague and would probably benefit from saying something like:  1.) Demonstrate a regular expression that, say, matches [a given pattern] in a string.  2.) Demonstrate a search-and-replace that replaces [a given pattern] in a string with [another given pattern]. ----[[Special:Contributions/71.208.164.92|71.208.164.92]] 11:42, 17 May 2011 (UTC)
