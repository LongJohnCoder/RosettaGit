Ready to come out of draft? --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 15:48, 6 July 2011 (UTC)
:I like it. I haven't seen any questions. I think people understand RPS pretty well. +1 for promotion. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 16:02, 6 July 2011 (UTC)
:: RPS is pretty easy to understand. I was more concerned about the AI player. I have been thinking about [[wp:rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock|Rock-Paper-Lizard-Spock]]. Particularly, having the same codebase be able to handle both forms of the game with minimal redundant code. That might be doable as an Extra Credit goal. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 16:11, 6 July 2011 (UTC)

::: That should be (above)   ''rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock''.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:38, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

::: Using proper "English" for the winner   (''paper disproves Spock,   paper covers rock, etc.)   while not being problematic, made my program entry a bit ... bulky. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:46, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

::: Implementing   ''rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock''   would expand programs into two directions:   more abstraction, or more bulk.   Abstraction is good, but harder to read and/or understand. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:50, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

== gooder English for winners ==
I've always played this game with the following verbiage: 
:::*   Rock breaks scissors.
:::*   Scissors cuts paper.
:::*   Paper covers rock.

:When I've played it, it was:
:::*   Rock blunts scissors.
:::*   Scissors cuts paper.
:::*   Paper wraps rock.
