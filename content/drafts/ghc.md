{{implementation|Haskell}}The '''Glasgow Haskell Compiler''' (or '''GHC''') is a compiler for the functional programming language [[Haskell]].  GHC includes an interactive environment for Haskell, known as GHCi.

It is also the de-facto testbed for new features, with useful ones eventually being adopted into the language standard.
