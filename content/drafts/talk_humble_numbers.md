== Wikipedia, humble numbers ==
Interestingly, the only entry for   '''humble numbers'''   in Wikipedia is in 

      '''https://googology.wikia.org/wiki/Category:Humble_numbers'''

which is currently being reviewed for deletion. 

Searching for   ''humble numbers''   (within Wikipedia)   will get a re-direct to the Wikipedia entry   '''regular number'''.     -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 06:20, 26 August 2019 (UTC)
