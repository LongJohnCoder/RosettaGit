On the one hand this task says "assume current path" - on the other hand it says "/input.txt" which is in the root of the file system in windows, linux and MacOS at least since OS X. Is the task to delete <i>two</i> files and directories, one that is 'here' and one that is in the root? This is truly unclear to me.[[User:Sgeier|Sgeier]] 01:08, 8 April 2007 (EDT)

:While I'm at it: "for the second test" doesn't make sense - is the task to test something or to delete something? Color me puzzled. [[User:Sgeier|Sgeier]] 01:10, 8 April 2007 (EDT)

::You're right, neither component makes sense.  The task is still small; Season it to taste. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 10:41, 9 April 2007 (EDT)

::: OK, I tried to change the wording to clarify what I <i>think</i> the original poster meant. I'll make the same change to the other "file primitives". By all means holler at me if you think this is not what was really meant. [[User:Sgeier|Sgeier]] 00:15, 25 April 2007 (EDT)
