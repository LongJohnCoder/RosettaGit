== Really? ==

Vote for deletion. This is not really a programming language, more of a macro at best. (All right HQ9+ isn't much of one either but...) The entire purpose of this "language" is to assist spammers, trolls and skript kiddies. I am not much inclined to hand them tools on a platter or encourage them in any way. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 10:12, 25 September 2019 (UTC)

:Although I normally agree with you on this sort of matter, on this occasion I think you're being a bit harsh.

:The author of the task has posted a number of respectable contributions to RC in various languages and I'm sure just means this as a bit of fun.

:CopyPasta seems no worse to me than any other 'joke' esoteric language (such as HQ9+). Anyone who has reservations about using the clipboard on a shared machine can simply write to a memory buffer instead.

:However, there are a number of points about the task which are not particularly clear and it should, of course, just be a draft at this stage. --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 12:17, 25 September 2019 (UTC)

==Language==
RC tries to get through any school profanity filters so the 'u' should be changed to a '*' for example, for the purposes of an RC task. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 12:57, 25 September 2019 (UTC)
:Agreed, even if in reality most programmers swear like troopers - and with good reason :) --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 13:34, 25 September 2019 (UTC)
