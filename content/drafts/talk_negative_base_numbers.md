==possible additional numbers to be used==
Perhaps a negative number (such as   -15)   to base   -10,   and also zero  (to any negative base)   could/should be added to the numbers being converted to test the logic of the various programming entries.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 05:13, 15 January 2017 (UTC)

==possible extra credit option==
Since a few programming examples have shown the name of the language (being) used as a value   (possibly in base   -62),   why not add an extra credit to show the language name (as best as it can expressed)   for some   ''particular''   value?     (See the last example for the version 2 REXX entry.)   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 07:46, 15 January 2017 (UTC)

:Good idea. Do you want to update the task description? --[[User:TimSC|TimSC]] ([[User talk:TimSC|talk]]) 08:23, 15 January 2017 (UTC)

:: It's your entry, but I'll add the extra credit thingy if you want.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:27, 15 January 2017 (UTC)

::: I've added the extra credit task requirement of showing the computer language's name to be expressed.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 22:27, 28 January 2017 (UTC)
