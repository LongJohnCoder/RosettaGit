I created a [http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&gid=1877346 LinkedIn group for Rosetta Code].  I disabled the discussion features of that group; All of that should happen somewhere on the wiki proper.  The group is there to help RC folks network with each other, and to let them put it on their LI profiles if they so choose. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 04:32, 1 April 2009 (UTC)
