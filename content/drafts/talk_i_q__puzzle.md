== Peg Solitaire? ==

Should/could this be renamed to Peg Solitaire with a Wikipedia link to [[wp:Peg_solitaire]]? Or perhaps make or leave a stub for a generic Peg Solitaire page with this as a /Triangular sub-page?

It appears to be exactly the same, except that the triangle board shape is considered a minor variation there. The Wikipedia page even has a picture of a man playing the triangular version at a Cracker Barrel in Wisconsin :). &mdash;[[User:dchapes|dchapes]] ([[User talk:dchapes|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/dchapes|contribs]]) 16:44, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

:see [[Talk:Solve_the_no_connection_puzzle]]. The task should be Solve something. Note that this is a very simple Solitare to solve. I tried the Ruby solution on  a standard Solitare and decided the computer had suffered enough after 45 mins. Finding a fast heuristic for generalized Solitare will be a more interesting (challenging) task.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 13:06, 19 October 2014 (UTC)
