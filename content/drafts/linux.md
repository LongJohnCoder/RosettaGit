'''Linux''' is a largely [[:Category:POSIX|POSIX]]-compliant kernel similar to [[Unix]].

When combined with [[GNU]] libraries (e.g. [[wp:GNU C Library|glibc]]) and tools (e.g. [[Bourne Again SHell|bash]], find-utils, bin-utils...), 
the combination may be referred to as [[wp:GNU/Linux naming controversy|GNU/Linux]].  

Other arrangements are possible, such as using [[BusyBox]] 
in place of a standalone shell and other command-line tools.
