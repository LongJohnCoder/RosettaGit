== Task? ==

What's the justification for this being a task? There are no implementations at all at present, and if we've got modern hardware connected up we'd have to ask which joystick (the games console round here has two per controller). â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:42, 4 June 2011 (UTC)

The task is currently limited to only reading analog joysticks.  If the task was changed to only indicating the direction a joystick was moved in it would allow inclusion of digital joysticks.  Analog joysticks can also include indicating the direction and the degree to which movement in that direction is indicated.--[[User:Demivec|Demivec]] 18:51, 27 June 2011 (UTC)

:For a digital joystick, just use full extents, so a push up gives crosshair at top centre, a pull down and to the right gives bottom right. [[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 20:59, 27 June 2011 (UTC)
