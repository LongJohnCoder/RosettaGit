I like the idea of turning this into a category, and creating tasks for the problems it covers.  Unfortunately, I don't own a copy... --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 04:05, 28 August 2008 (UTC)
:For shame!...Actually I don't own it either :p. I don't know what sorts of tasks it would cover, but I was thinking about making a new task category for common CS problems. If this is made into a category it could be a subcategory of that.--[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 04:58, 28 August 2008 (UTC)
