{{library}}The Open'''GL''' '''U'''ser '''T'''oolkit, or '''GLUT''', is a toolkit for abstracting operating-system-specific details from programmers writing [[OpenGL]] applications.  The original is available, but no longer maintained. There are [http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/windowtoolkits/ multiple implementations of GLUT's API available].
