{{implementation|BASIC}}
'''BASICA''' is a [[:Category:BASIC|BASIC]] [[interpreter]] developed by [[Microsoft]] and included with early versions of [[DOS|PC-DOS]]. It requires ROM BASIC (a BASIC interpreter contained in a ROM chip; a standard feature of the earliest [[IBM]] PCs) to function correctly. After a few years, BASICA was superseded by [[:Category:GW-BASIC|GW-BASIC]]. (GW-BASIC is identical to BASICA, except that where BASICA requires ROM BASIC, GW-BASIC is entirely contained within the interpreter itself. It was included with several versions of DOS, and was eventually superseded by [[QuickBASIC#QBasic|QBasic]].)
