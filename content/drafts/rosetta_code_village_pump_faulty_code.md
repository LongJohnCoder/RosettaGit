1.) I hope this is the right place to talk about this: [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithms/Comb_sort Task:Comb sort] has a faulty pseudocode. Look for the discussion there.

2.) I have recently uploaded a screenshot, which had unfortunately its name changed to GUI.png in the process. I can not find an option to delete that file, and turn here for help, please.

3.) Since I recently uploaded the code for a Brainf*** interpreter, I have tried to put it on a separate page on its own, like Ada, but now there are two entries on [[:Category:AutoHotkey]] for Execute Brain****, (like BASIC) what do I do to fix this again?

:I fixed #3, it looks like #2 is already fixed, and #1 has discussion on the talk page of the task. I think they're all handled for now. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:23, 16 May 2010 (UTC)

:: A late Thank you for fixing #3, sorry to have not thanked you right away. Also a late Thank you to the unknown fixer of #2. And the discussion for #1 was successful, by the way. --[[User:Wolf|Wolf]] 22:32, 29 May 2010 (UTC)
