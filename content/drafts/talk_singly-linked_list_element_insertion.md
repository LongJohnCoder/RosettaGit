== Why has the task been split into two tasks? ==
Why has the task of using linked list been split into two tasks, [[Singly-Linked List (element)]] and [[Singly-Linked List (element insertion)]]? This makes it more difficult to follow what is going on and to test the examples. Those two can not be considered as separate independent tasks. --[[User:PauliKL|PauliKL]] 12:24, 19 November 2008 (UTC)

: '''Agree.''' Feel free to merge these tasks and [[Singly-Linked List (traversal)]] into a [[Singly-linked list]] task.  In my opinion, the same could go for [[Doubly-linked list]] and [[Arrays]]. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 21:39, 19 November 2008 (UTC)
:We already knew about this ([[Rosetta Code:TODO]]), but no one got around to it.--[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 23:55, 19 November 2008 (UTC)
: The separation of the linked list tasks was my attempt to break what would have been a set of larger tasks into several smaller ones.  It was unnecessary; They should be merged. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 02:33, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

== There should be a link on this page to singly-linked list removal ==
Right now only definition, insertion, traversal are linked to. I noticed there are barely any entries for removal, and I'm guessing part of the reason is that the removal page isn't linked to from any of the others.
