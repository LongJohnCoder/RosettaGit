These are well known as the Smarandache prime-digital sequence. I would suggest renaming this task so.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 12:35, 31 May 2019 (UTC)

:I tried googling for a name earlier and failed to come up with anything but now we know what they're called, I'd second your suggestion. --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 13:22, 31 May 2019 (UTC)

:Ah. Thank you. I suspected that these would already have a formal name but wasn't able to turn it up with a cursory search. Renamed task. (again... ðŸ™„) --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 15:26, 31 May 2019 (UTC)
