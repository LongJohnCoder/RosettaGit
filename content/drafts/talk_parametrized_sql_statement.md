== Spelling ==

I just noticed that the title of this task seems to use a mixture of US and British spellings. The suffix "-ize" is usually used in US English, while "-ise" is used in British English. I would spell the word "parameterized", but I'm not sure which rules that follows for the "meter" part--probably US. Would it be better to just call this "Prepared SQL statement"? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:00, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
