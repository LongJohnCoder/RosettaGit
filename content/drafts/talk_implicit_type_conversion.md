==Note on task description==
Hi, you state:
:''"The following code samples demonstrate ..."''
It might be better not to reference the examples to be written, but instead state more clearly what it is that needs to be done to fulfil the task. You might want to use a list describing all the things to be done for example.

At the moment it seems hard to extract the task specifics from the introduction. (To me). 

Thanks. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 07:21, 11 October 2015 (UTC)
