In my opinion, Nautical bell differs insignificantly from the [[Morse code]] task.

: And in my opinion it's got enough differences to be worthwhile. In particular, it has both timed-event handling and non-trivial encode rules for the written output; it's not just “play a sound”. It isn't just a matter of taking one solution and substituting a few values in it, but rather it takes more effort than that (i.e., new code). –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 10:46, 20 April 2013 (UTC)

:Hi LambertDW. I implemented both tasks in Python. Whilst there may be similarities that ''might'' warrent a Cf. on each task mentioning the other, I too think they are ''easily'' different enough to be separate tasks on RC. I had to use the scheduling module on this task and needed winsound to complete the Morse code task for example. The tasks aren't even close to being seen as duplicates in my opinion, although you did not mention duplicates - duplication is an easy reason to get tasks merged on RC. 
P.S. whilst expressing a difference of opinion, there's no malice attached and I have been known to be swayed by another's argument :-)
