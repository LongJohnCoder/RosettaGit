Isn't this just an application of the permutation task to a particular collection of objects and in a particular language? –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:03, 5 August 2012 (UTC)
:I've put a question to the [[User:Trombone1st‎|users page]]. Maybe you would like to add to it as it seems to be the first contribution of the user and I am not sure if they know enough about RC. I was thinking of deleting the page if the user and I didn't have a conversation about the page after some time. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 10:20, 5 August 2012 (UTC)
