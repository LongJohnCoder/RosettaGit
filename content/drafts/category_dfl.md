{{library}}The ''D Forms Library'', or '''DFL''', is a Win32 windowing library for the [[D]] language. DFL attempts to bring a high level, easy to use interface to the Win32 [[API]].

Selected Features of DFL:

* Creation and management of [[GUI]] applications with a simple, object-oriented interface.
* Event handlers for almost any event can be attached to many objects, such as controls, forms, and menus.
* Controls can be docked on the parent form, so resize code isn't needed.
* DFL provides sockets that do not block the GUI thread.
