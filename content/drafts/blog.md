Rosetta Code has a [http://blog.rosettacode.org/ blog] which shows a weekly summary of RC events and other unscheduled articles. The weekly updates give run-downs of site activity, new tasks and languages, and suggestions for the next week's activities. It's a good place to talk a bit about recent events. Other good options for this are the [[Village Pump:Home|forum]] and the [[Help:IRC|IRC channel]].
