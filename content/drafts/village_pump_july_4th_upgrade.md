=Rosetta Theme=
Have we completely abandoned the Rosetta theme? Will we bring it back later? what about that sweet new logo that as made for it? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 12:41, 6 July 2009 (UTC)
: The Rosetta theme was built off of the old version of Monobook, and had issues that apparently stemmed from an old, badly-done upgrade.  I hope to build a new theme, but but the logo is still around; It'll be back. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 14:23, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

=ImplSearchBot=
Have the bots been restarted? I don't see any edits from them today. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:22, 6 July 2009 (UTC)
: ImplSearchBot is turned off until the server settings are stable.  I wrote it with basic safeguards against failures, but those code paths haven't been practically tested, so I haven't been risking it. I don't know about the status of any other bots.  I think Guga360 is the only other person with an authorized bot account. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 20:40, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

==MathMl stuff problems?==
See [[Multiple Regression]]. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 04:07, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
:Seems to be OK now. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 13:39, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
Yep. Thanks. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 15:33, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
: It kinda worries me; I looked, didn't see anything wrong, and didn't change anything.  I don't know why it started working. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 21:05, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
