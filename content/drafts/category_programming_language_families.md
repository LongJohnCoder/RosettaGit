-->

This is an attempt to group/organize programming languages into families/categories.

To see how this might work, some of the languages on [[99 Bottles of Beer]]
have been moved 

to subpages by group, e.g. 
one subpage for assembly-languages,
one subpage for basic-languages, 
etc. 

See [[:Category:Collection Members]]

There is already a lot covered in Wikipedia about language-categories:
