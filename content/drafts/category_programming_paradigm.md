A programming paradigm is a group of (usually) semantic features of a language that work together to allow a particular style of programming. A language may support multiple paradigms at once (e.g., [[Java]] is both an [[Imperative programming|imperative]] language and an [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] language).
