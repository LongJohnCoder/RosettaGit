==The idea==

Thanks to Gerard for this [[Talk:Loops/with_multiple_ranges#other_DO_loop_cases| inspiration]].

The examples show that range functionality varies between languages. If moving between languages you need to make the effort to understand the new functionality. It was pointed out that the values are not "Wrong" and may have well defined actions in a language: I apologise, but just loved the mild tongue twister in "wrong ranges" :-)
