Can someone upload my geshi file to the appropriate place on rosettacode for me?

I have validated it as best I can on my site (http://phix.is-great.org/contrib/langcheck.php and http://phix.is-great.org/test.php)
It can be downloaded from http://phix.is-great.org/phix.zip =[[User:Petelomax|Pete Lomax]] ([[User talk:Petelomax|talk]]) 04:15, 3 October 2015 (UTC)

:ok, obviously I'm doing something wrong. I've managed to add a pull request for Phix to the github site. If anyone wants to delete this page, feel free. [[User:Petelomax|Pete Lomax]] ([[User talk:Petelomax|talk]]) 01:03, 25 October 2015 (UTC)
