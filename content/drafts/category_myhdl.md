MyHDL - From Python to Silicon!

MyHDL is an open source Python package that lets you go from Python to silicon. With MyHDL, you create a Python model of the hardware system, which you can then simulate, and validate, or export to Verilog or VHDL, and take it to a silicon implementation from there.

On  www.myhdl.org   you will find everything you need to get started - and to keep going - with MyHDL. Have fun!
