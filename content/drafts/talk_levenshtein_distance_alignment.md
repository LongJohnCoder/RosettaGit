==Algo?==
Is there an algorithm you can point me at? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 15:07, 3 May 2013 (UTC)
:I don't know any reference, but anyway it's not really different from the Levenshtein distance algorithm.  The only difference is that you don't only memoize the distance, you also memoize the alignments.--[[User:Grondilu|Grondilu]] ([[User talk:Grondilu|talk]]) 00:38, 4 May 2013 (UTC)
