### Cartesian product task ?


Generating a Cartesian product can often be seen arising as a component of solutions to Rosetta Code tasks, but I can't immediately see a task in which the generation of Cartesian products (two lists or n-ary) is explicitly focal.

It seems to me like a task that might generate a useful reference and point of comparison [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 15:08, 29 May 2017 (UTC)

== The Java code doesn't work? ==

It returns a nested list of an incomplete product?
