This category will be retrieved periodically by bot.  All subcategories of this category will have their listings saved in the form of a static [[JSON]] file, which will be available via HTTP somewhere on the server.  These JSON files will be used internally by ImplSearchBot, as well as for other purposes such as generating RSS feeds containing notices of additions and removals.

Any '''pages''' added to this category will not be processed, only subcategories.  Add any category you'd like to be so processed as a subcategory of this one.
