==Draft status==
This should remain a draft task until such time as there are a number of implementations (4, perhaps?) of which at least one should do the extra credit item. (Once that's been reached, just remove the “<tt>draft</tt>” word from the leading template declaration. Hope the task graduates soon!) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 21:36, 13 July 2011 (UTC)

== Fix it please! ==

Can someone please roll back my edit? I was attempting to put the task data within the script, and that backfired royally.
here's a raw paste of the AutoHotkey task... http://www.autohotkey.net/paste/text/jz9mfh --[[User:Crazyfirex|Crazyfirex]] 23:47, 13 September 2011 (UTC)
:I managed it myself, but can't put the AutoHotkey back... --[[User:Crazyfirex|Crazyfirex]] 23:50, 13 September 2011 (UTC)
::I have restored your AutoHotkey code, with a different wiki syntax: I used &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;...&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;, not &lt;lang AutoHotkey&gt;...&lt;/lang&gt;, but there is no syntax highlighting. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:55, 14 September 2011 (UTC)
::: The easiest way out is to go for the full extra credit so that you pull the data from RC rather than supplying it. :-) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 09:28, 23 September 2011 (UTC)
:::: And I apologize for the load this puts on the RC server as my code goes through and finds things to fix… –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 12:58, 23 September 2011 (UTC)
::::: Meh. I'm pretty confident the server could take a full Slashdotting or Redditing. Your puny little script means nothing to me. ;P --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 13:51, 23 September 2011 (UTC)
:::::: Notwithstanding Michael's confidence, I put test results [[User:CRGreathouse/lang tags|here]] so that people don't run this needlessly. [[User:CRGreathouse|CRGreathouse]] 01:58, 28 November 2011 (UTC)
