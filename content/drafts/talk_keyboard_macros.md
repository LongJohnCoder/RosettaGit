Is this just doing keyboard bindings? If so, perhaps this task should be renamed... —[[User:Dkf|Dkf]] 20:41, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

Renamed to What? Keyboard Bindings? 
I don't have a problem with that —[[User:tinku99|tinku99]]

:I don't know about renaming. But some more detailed description might help. And in the implementations, there should be some description or comments to tell us what is going on. --[[User:PauliKL|PauliKL]] 14:10, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
