{{library}}{{toolkit}}{{provides|Windowing UI}}'''Swing''' is a lightweight [[GUI]] framework for [[Java]] built on top of [[AWT]] which provides a look-and-feel closer to the [[platform]] upon which Java is running, or a look-and-feel of the programmer's choosing. It relies on AWT's <tt>Container</tt>s, but instead of relying on the [[OS]] for widget rendering, it renders itself. This feature gives it its lightweight nature.
