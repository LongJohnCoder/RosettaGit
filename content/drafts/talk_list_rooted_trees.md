==Definition of ways to nest==
If I understand correctly, OEIS A81 lists the number of unique ways n bags can be nested, eg 9 for 5 bags. The task description states "As an example output, run 5 bags. There should be 12 ways.". In addition, "( () (()) () )" is considered different from "( (()) () () )". Please explain.
