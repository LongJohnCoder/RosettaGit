==Obsessed??==
Some contributors are obsessed with:
* Very long historical and technical preludes;
* Multiple comments (almost on each line);
* Unnecessary multiple pound and other signs.
All this makes code "dirty", hard to read and maintain. I'm just curious: who will read such preludes, comments?

An obvious sample is the first version of dragon curve in R. I thought that contributor is for sure obsessed with pounds...

Or trying to camouflage original code.. Although original code has a lot of pounds too,
but RC contributor added even more! LOL See for yourself:

BTW, it’s impossible to find who is the contributor of the first version of R.--[[User:AnatolV|AnatolV]]
: Probably not a great idea to make disparaging remarks about other peoples code. That being said, it's a public wiki. If there is code that is unidiomatic or messy, clean it up. Just be aware that some users are very protective of their contributions and coding styles. 
: As far as who contributed the first R example, looks like it was [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Werewolff519 Werewolff519]; see [http://rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Dragon_curve&type=revision&diff=196234&oldid=195807 this revision] --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 12:58, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
::TYVM Thundergnat! Now I can see: he attached solution to Perl with no comments. I did the same when I started here. LOL But later I've found it is useful to leave a short comment. I was hoping the contributor is one of the authors of the cited article. But, in general, it doesn't matter for me.

== Scrollable examples? ==

The scrollbar in the D example freaked me out at first. I'm not sure how good it would look if all examples did that. I think we should either have all scrolling examples (only for longer examples, of course) or none at all. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 06:46, 4 April 2008 (MDT)

The QD example? That's an SDL window; it shouldn't have scrollbars. I certainly didn't code any in. [[Special:Contributions/79.213.117.79|79.213.117.79]] 03:33, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

:I think he's referring to the presentation of the text mode example program itself. —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:00, 17 September 2009 (UTC)
