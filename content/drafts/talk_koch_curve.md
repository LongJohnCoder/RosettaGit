==A single Koch curve or a triangle of Koch curves forming a Koch snowflake ?==
The terms ('curve' and 'snowflake') are used as if co-extensive in the current edit of the referenced wiki article, but I'm not sure that that's reliable or correct. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 12:52, 2 September 2019 (UTC)

:From the Wikipedia article: "The Koch curve originally described by Helge von Koch is constructed using only one of the three sides of the original triangle. In other words, three Koch curves make a Koch snowflake."

:I (Perl 6) chose to show a Koch snowflake as it fulfils the requirement of "Draw a Koch curve", but is more interesting IMO; most other contributors seem to gone the same route. Technically, using the mathematical definition,  a Koch snowflake '''is''' a curve. It just isn't only '''a''' Koch curve, but 3. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 13:14, 2 September 2019 (UTC)


I agree with [[User:Hout|Hout]]. Three Koch curves makes a snow flake.
Note that if most people look at the existing programs for test cases, 
so if the first one had a snow flake, the others will just copy it.

The original 1904 paper may be found here [http://staff.math.su.se/lenb/dok/von-Koch-1904.pdf Sur une courbe continue sans tangente obtenue par une construction géométrique élémentnire] complete with 5 figures. This work predates the realization that applying these rules to a triangle creates a fractal which may be used to explain snowflakes.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 14:53, 3 September 2019 (UTC)

: Perfect – I was trying to find an accessible copy of that. Many thanks. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 21:16, 3 September 2019 (UTC)
