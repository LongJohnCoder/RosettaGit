This doesn't seem to have been updated for a while â€“ it's looking a little quaint.

Perhaps at least 3 things missing ?

:#Haskell as a source of innovation in other languages
:#Support for parallelism (multicore hardware etc)
:#Haskell in Facebook's realtime spam responses (http://www.wired.com/2015/09/facebooks-new-anti-spam-system-hints-future-coding/)
