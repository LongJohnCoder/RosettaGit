==Moved to draft status.==
Hi, The link was not found when I tried.

:That is the internet for you. I've changed to a new link which works today--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 15:08, 13 January 2014 (UTC)

The output needs to be formatted or state something like the 1000'th to 1025'th (inclusive) digits should be computed and shown on the page as being equal to ... 

It would be better if you preferably put the algorithm in the task description if you could. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 15:33, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

: Agreed. Right now we've got a task that produces a large amount of output that it is difficult to check by eye, and an algorithm in a paper rather than on this page. That's a good reason to keep it as draft. (At the very least, copy the key equations to this page and think of a way to reduce the volume of output in a useful non-trivial way.) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 09:12, 16 January 2014 (UTC)

::I quite like Gerard Schildberger's idea of showing the number of correct digits per iteration, perhaps to 100 million. http://www.angio.net/pi/ section Repeating Patterns in Pi tells us 'Jonathan Day recently (02/1999) noticed that there appear to be no simple, repeating patterns longer than 10 digits. He found 9 6's at 45681781, 9 7's at 24658601 and 9 8's at 46663520.' It would be interseting to check this --[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 12:56, 16 January 2014 (UTC)
: I've included the key equations from the paper; people who want more can read the paper for themselves. –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 09:34, 16 January 2014 (UTC)


==Formulae made invisible by under-tested cosmetic edits at  04:44, 19 April 2016 ==

Under-tested cosmetic edits made to the task page at  04:44, 19 April 2016, including the injection of spaces around expressions in &lt;math&gt; tags, have left the task description formulae completely invisible to all browsers which display the graphic file version of formulae rather than processing the MathML (this is, in fact, the majority of browsers). The MediaWiki processor does not currently expect such spaces, and generates syntactically ill-formed HTML if they are introduced. Other aspects of these cosmetic edits may further compound the problem. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 10:38, 24 September 2016 (UTC)

: Visibility of formulae restored by [[User:Bmulvey|Bmulvey]] on 18 Oct 2016 [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 19:06, 18 October 2016 (UTC)
