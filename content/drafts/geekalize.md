When Rosetta Code was [http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/21/1410208 Slashdotted], Dreamhost killed the hosting. (With a peak server load of 180, that's understandable.)  '''[http://geekalize.com Geekalize]''' contacted [[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] and offered free hosting and unlimited bandwidth.  That arrangement lasted until September 10th, when benign circumstances required Rosetta Code to move to another hosting provider.

Geekalize is a social-networking site targeted at the geek community.  The fact that Rosetta Code is still alive is due solely to their generosity.  I, on behalf of Rosetta Code, its community, and the GRCC Computer Club, thank Geekalize for their efforts.
