Tasks in this category demonstrate various initialization techniques.

== Overview of initialization ==

The initialization stage consists of a set of early steps (or substages) that a computer application program performs to prepare itself for basic operation. A computer programmer may use a basic template that contains the initialization code for the program.

== Substages of initialization ==

The initialization substages of a program includes:

* Population of variables with default values
* Preliminary system checks
* Interpretation of command line parameters
* Consideration of the environment
* Processing of the configuration files
* Memory and resource reservation
* Service registration
* System checks and preparation
* Freeing the initialization code segment
