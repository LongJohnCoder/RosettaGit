==What is the intent of the task?==
* The "sum of" does not mean the same as the "count of" numbers.  Which does the author intend?
* Second, the description should say "positive integers" if that is what is intended, because there are an infinite number of negative integers below 1000.
* Third, "below" doesn't include 1000, so maybe it should say "not greater than"?
Thanks.  --[[User:TimToady|TimToady]] ([[User talk:TimToady|talk]]) 16:16, 14 May 2013 (UTC)

:The reading of the task where:
:* Sum means sum and not count.
:* It is taken to mean positive integers.
:* Below means up to, but not including.
:...happens to have REXX and Python solutions following TimToady's Perl 6 lead. I quite liked that interpretation. If the task moves away from this, could we create a another task to preserve this interpretation? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 17:26, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
::I've cleaned up the task to be consistent with the (current) majority interpretation. --[[User:TimToady|TimToady]] ([[User talk:TimToady|talk]]) 17:38, 14 May 2013 (UTC)

::: shouldn't the title be Multiples ?? --[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 18:21, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
:::: Current title will do fine; we don't want extra capital letters in it if they're not proper names. –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 22:08, 15 May 2013 (UTC)

::I didn't really care for the Perl6 solution; it misses the fact that you're just talking triangular numbers with a little wrapping. Making that explicit (which I did in the Tcl solution) gives a really neat piece of code (one general mathematical definition, and a very simple pattern of application to the problem). –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 22:08, 15 May 2013 (UTC)

I've brought this out of of draft, since the the task seems reasonable by consensus, and the
original author can always pose a different draft instead if that was the intent.  Also, I've taken the liberty of adding an extra credit for the analytical solutions that scale better than direct summation.  --[[User:TimToady|TimToady]] ([[User talk:TimToady|talk]]) 00:28, 15 May 2013 (UTC)

==It's a Project Euler problem too==
I don't do Project Euler, but I do follow Stack Overflow and one of their [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16553869/programming-challenge-help-python questions] was asking for help for a project Euler question which got me to the site. This task happens to be their [http://projecteuler.net/problem=1 problem 1]. I note that the RC task is worded differently, and it is not clear if Project Euler is the originator of the problem but since I made a connection, I thought I'd share. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 23:00, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
