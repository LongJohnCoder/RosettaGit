{{language}}TIScript is a language that uses [[JavaScript]] as a base with some [[Python]] features added: classes and namespaces, properties, decorators, etc. TIScript has a compiler producing [[bytecode]]s and VM running that bytecodes. VM uses heap with garbage collector.

Please read my article [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/TIScript.aspx TIScript vs JavaScript]. TIScript is hosted on  [http://code.google.com/p/tiscript/ GoogleCode] 

Minimal hello-world in TIScript:

```javascript
stdout.println("Hello world");
```
