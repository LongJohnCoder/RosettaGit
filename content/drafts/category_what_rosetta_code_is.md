Rosetta Code is many things to many people. This is a category tracking pages where people say what it is to ''them''. If you like, put something in your user page (or somewhere else specific to you) about what Rosetta Code is to you, and add '''<nowiki>[[Category:What Rosetta Code Is]]</nowiki>''' to that page.
