Is this a library? A code example? What's going on here? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 13:15, 29 April 2011 (UTC)
: According to WP, FoxPro was, more or less a combination database system and programming langauge. Visual FoxPro was object-oriented, while FoxPro 2 was not. I remember having Visual FoxPro with Visual Studio ages ago, but I never used it. I don't know more about them than that. However, this page should probably be refactored as a language page. The code itself looks like it might be an implementation of [[Five weekends]] --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:08, 29 April 2011 (UTC)
