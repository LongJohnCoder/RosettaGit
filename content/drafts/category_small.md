The language small was made in 2015 by David Getindor. It is licensed under the GGL license and has a goal of having the largest sourcefiles possible and the least amount of needed commands. It is considered a great code golf language because you will always have a bigger filesize, therefore you win by having a larger number of bytes.

Small has two different commands:

"+" for incrementing the counter 

"." for printing the counter as an ascii character

You may notice that small has no way of deincremementing the counter, that is because the counter resets at 250 and that makes subtraction simply not needed.
