Was this supposed to be a task subcategory? I never understood these tasks, so I need help. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 04:50, 18 February 2009 (UTC)
: I suspect it was either that or as a library/API usage category.  The latter seems more approriate.  The appropriate task subcategory would likely fall in the realm of network management or authentication. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 17:16, 18 February 2009 (UTC)
