== Language name inconsistent with content ==

So… is this about a language called “Babel” or about a language called “BabelLanguage”? If it's the former, we need to rename it (and fix a few examples) before things get too annoying to sort out. If it's the latter, we have page content that's inconsistent with its own title and so should fix that, though that's less critical. <small>(Note that this is a site that's based on MediaWiki, not Moin, so we don't need to smash words together to make internal links. OK?)</small> –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 00:03, 1 June 2012 (UTC)
:The language creator (or someone who sounded like the creator) was in the IRC channel. The language is called "Babel". Make any changes that are necessary. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 01:34, 1 June 2012 (UTC)
:: Moved. Or rather everything moved around, but not ''actually'' moved; categories can't be moved in MW… –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:32, 1 June 2012 (UTC)
