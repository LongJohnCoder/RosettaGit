Is there a way we can make the list on this template take up less space? It's starting to get kinda big. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:18, 25 November 2008 (UTC)
: The simplest way would probably be to reduce the number of explicitly mentioned sorting algorithms. There's the category for a list of all of them, so it simply doesn't make sense to repeat that list in the template. --[[User:Ce|Ce]] 13:17, 26 November 2008 (UTC)
