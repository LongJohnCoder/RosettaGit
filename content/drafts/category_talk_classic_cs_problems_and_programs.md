I think we should use the term "Computer Science", rather than "CS" here. This category would be better named as simply "Computer Science".

:I chose "CS" when I made this category because expanding it would make the category name really long. I didn't think "Computer science" would be specific enough (since pretty much everything here is computer science). --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:19, 24 April 2011 (UTC)
:: I'm easy with the name. The people who would use the category (under any name) are likely to know the expansion of the abbreviation anyway. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 17:00, 24 April 2011 (UTC)
