Loops are [[:Category:Control Structures|control structures]] that allow sections of code to be executed repeatedly according to the controlling conditions of the loop. There are two types of loops: iterative loops and [[:Category:Conditional loops|conditional loops]]

This category is about iterative loops. Iterative loop repeatedly execute a set of instructions as the iterator steps through a series of values. Types of iterative loops include [[Loops/For|forloop]]s and [[Loops/Foreach|foreach]] loops. Tasks in this category show how iterative loops can be used to accomplish repetitive tasks.
