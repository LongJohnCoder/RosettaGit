In what significant way does this differ from [[Sort using a custom comparator]]? Or [[Natural sorting]] for that matter? Actually, one could directly use the code from [[Natural sorting]] to sort lists of OIDs. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 00:14, 8 July 2016 (UTC)

: I think it's okay if one task is a generalization of another, because the more specific version might be able to take shortcuts that can lead to different approaches in some languages. --[[User:Smls|Smls]] ([[User talk:Smls|talk]]) 12:21, 24 August 2016 (UTC)

: I have asked similar questions about the multiplicity of the various "sorting" tasks. I have come to accept it, because apparently sorting is a thing and people like to play with different ways of doing it. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 12:48, 24 August 2016 (UTC)

== Correctly sorted? ==

That output has some undocumented decorations on it, presumably those are not relevant to the task? --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 00:32, 8 July 2016 (UTC)

: I rewrote the task description and replaced the test-case with a new one, now without ASCII decorations. --[[User:Smls|Smls]] ([[User talk:Smls|talk]]) 12:21, 24 August 2016 (UTC)

Note:  OID numbers start with "."  dot
       Example:  .1.3.6.1.4
