Rosetta Code is now (or imminently will be) requiring email confirmation in order for users to edit.

There are two reasons for this:

# There has been a pattern of (presumably accidental) vandalism by at least one user who has not supplied an email address, who is not reading (or acknowledging) their talk page, and who is evading bans. While we appreciate the content they add, the lack of communication means we can't deal with the damage they're doing. This is unacceptable. The ban evasion is also unacceptable, and is likely to result in a longer-term ban, but this likely would not have become an issue if communication were possible.
# CAPTCHAs are no longer sufficient to cope with spammers, and additional means are needed.

I will note, again, that it is is my policy, and will remain my policy, that Rosetta Code will not sell or release users' email addresses without a driving legal obligation.

Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I refer you to [[Special:Preferences]], where you can control your email settings. Also note a potential privacy issue: If you send another user email, Rosetta Code's server will use your provided email address in the Reply-To field it sends to the other user. Bear that in mind before using the [[Special:EmailUser]] feature.
