== Uploading vs linking to external images ==

Interesting addition to the programming languages represented at Rosetta Code.

I wonder, though, if linking to externally hosted screenshots (like [[99_Bottles_of_Beer#App_Inventor]] currently does) is the best way to showcase App Inventor "source code", because it adds an extra maintenance burden to make sure that the links always remain alive (and if they go dead, and no one here happens to have a backup copy, the solutions will be lost).

Why not upload the images to Rosetta Code and embed them directly on the respective task pages?

However, I'm still pretty new here myself, so it would be nice if one of the admins could weigh in on the issue.

: Update: Apparently, image uploading is temporarily disabled (see  [http://irclog.perlgeek.de/rosettacode/2014-01-29#i_8193055 IRC log]) --[[User:Smls|Smls]] ([[User talk:Smls|talk]]) 16:47, 29 January 2014 (UTC)
