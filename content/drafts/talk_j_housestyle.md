== J ==

For those who find the [[J/HouseStyle#J|J solution]] intriguing, but cannot read it, here is an exposition.  Of course I will not describe J's grammar or syntax here, because that would be too detailed and boring, and would require all other expositions to discuss it as well (which would be redundant).  I will just focus on the high-level, interesting and differentiating aspects of the solution.  For those interested in more detail, I might direct them to [http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/dict.htm the J dictionary], or even [[J/SpellingAndGrammar|start a centralized page]] describiing J's spelling (rhematics) and grammar.
