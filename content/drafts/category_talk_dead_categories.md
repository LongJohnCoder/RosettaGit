== Now what? ==

So do we want to delete these categories? Are we keeping them for any other purposes? They can be redirected where appropriate if you want. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:37, 8 September 2011 (UTC)

: I invented <nowiki>{{dead category}}</nowiki> because I wanted a parking lot for pages like [[:Category:Bash]] or [[:Category:Less Than 5 Examples]]. These abandoned categories have no members, but their pages still exist.

: The problem with redirected categories is that they seem not to move their pages. For example, if someone redirects [[:Category:Iterative loops]] to [[:Category:Iteration]], then all the pages in Iterative loops stay in Iterative loops, not Iteration. There is no problem with redirecting empty categories; now that [[:Category:Iterative loops]] is empty, it can again be a redirect. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:47, 10 September 2011 (UTC)
