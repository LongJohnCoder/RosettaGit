The specific formatting shown seems unfair to platforms <strike>which aren't J</strike> which don't have built-in table-formatting features, in that it takes a lot of code to generate and is not especially related to Sierpinski. Also, the successive nesting of table borders causes the shape to deviate from the proper fractal (e.g. the outermost holes will be [order] cells in from the corner rather than 1. Because of these, I am going to submit examples which do not use that formatting. --[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 06:43, 15 March 2008 (MDT)

When people are putting their output in their language solutions, can they ''please'' not put excessively much? There really isn't any need to have massive amounts of output from samples; we get the picture. Really. All it does is make the page longer for next to no gain. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 21:11, 19 March 2012 (UTC)

:Might help if the task specified that N=2 be used for examples. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 19:35, 21 March 2012 (UTC)
