Umm, Not such an easy distinction to make.

Perl, Python, Ruby, TCL,.... are interpreted languages that have bytecode. sometimes called byte-coded interpreters, but when shortened, ''never'' called compilers.

Java started out as, and may still be in some implementations, compiled to bytecode but known as a compiled language.

Lisp and Forth have been known to be compiled/interpreted down to machine code/byte code ''and'' have CPU's whose machine code/byte code was created for their express use. I think we should be intentionally 'woolly' here, which fits how execution method is categorized in practice, or omit. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 05:23, 31 July 2009 (UTC)
:I put Java in Compiled/Bytecode because the translation to bytecode (<tt>javac</tt>) is normally completely separate from running the program. Other languages may compile to bytecode as they run, which seems more like interpretation to me. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 12:04, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

This seems to be implemented as if one language can only support one execution method.  But some languages simultaneously support multiple execution methods in the same implementation and many languages support multiple implementations.  --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 16:40, 22 April 2010 (UTC)
