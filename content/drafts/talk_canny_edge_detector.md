Hi. I just found that yesterday I created this page not being logged in... Is there a way to change my IP address 87.224.129.185 to my nickname `firstfire' in the history?

:Maybe. Drop a note to [[User talk:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] and ask him. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 15:32, 6 March 2012 (UTC)
:: I don't know that he can change that in the logs, but if you're logged in now and do some changes you'll be associated anyway. You can also manually set a watch on the page. (Remember, we don't object to pages being started by “anon” users; we just object to them being on non-RC topics like turkish mortgage refinancing…) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 15:36, 6 March 2012 (UTC)

This task could use a reference image, to run against. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 07:57, 16 June 2014 (UTC)
