For F_word<sub>37</sub>, that would be 24,157,817 line segments drawn.  That would fill
every pixel of a 4Kx4K display with some 800,000 segments left over.  Maybe one
of the earlier Fwords, with a few thousand line segments?

: I did draw the 37 element one (scaled to fit in 500&times;500); it takes rather a lot of resources to hold lines with that many segments in (but rather less to plot them, provided you're not in a hurry). Good thing I've got plenty of memory and a fast processor… –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 16:43, 24 August 2013 (UTC)
