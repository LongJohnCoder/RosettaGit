==Note from original author==
When it doubt assume you have the freedom to define the requirements as whatever you feel is most appropriate in your language of choice. --[[User:Kentros|Kentros]] ([[User talk:Kentros|talk]]) 01:31, 31 August 2017 (UTC)

==why entered as a ''task'' instead of ''draft task''?==
Why was this entry entered as a   ''task''   instead of a   ''draft task''?   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 03:08, 16 August 2017 (UTC)

... ahhh ...   I see that this ''task'' was demoted to a ''draft task'' by   [[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]].   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:34, 16 August 2017 (UTC)

==task clarification==
I assume we are to code programs to handle the general case, not just the file specified/mandated to be used as a test case.
:True.  Originally, I suggested a specific text file.  I've taken that off and now leave it to the example writer. --[[User:Kentros|Kentros]] ([[User talk:Kentros|talk]]) 01:32, 31 August 2017 (UTC)

What is a "word"?
:A single distinct meaningful element of speech. I speak words. How speech is written is very much language, time and individual dependent. Linguistically Speech, Speach, or even Speych have been used for the same word. Don't mention Donaudampfschifffahrtselektrizit√§tenhauptbetriebs. For the purpose of this task I would suggest using the concept of 'orthographic word' which works well for English. Not well for Ancient Greek and Egyptian.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 12:46, 17 August 2017 (UTC)
Is 1997 a word?   How about 20?   How about twenty? 

What letters can be included in a word?

There are a lot of French accented letters in the prescribed text, but are we to be limited to   ''just''   the French accented letters? 

German?     Czech?     Which dialects of Greek?     Logographic kanji?     Kana?    

What other characters can be included in a word?
:Characters not included in the alphabet are called logograms. They include numbers, foreign letters and mojos. IüíñNY is 1 orthographic word. The sentence '1 orthographic word' contains 3 orthographic words'--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 12:58, 17 August 2017 (UTC)
Are words that are hyphenated one word or two?
:1 orthographic word--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 12:52, 17 August 2017 (UTC)
What about words like:     '''jack-o'-lantern'''
:1 orthographic word--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 12:51, 17 August 2017 (UTC)
What about split words across lines   (if there are possi-

bly present)?

Are words that contain an apostrophe to be included   (such as '''let'''&apos;'''s''')?

What about words that contain non-Latin (Roman) letters?

As it happens, those non-Latin letters don't show up in the   ''top ten''.

What '''exactly''' is the ''text''   (start and stop)   that is contained in the web-page to be used? 

Should we also use the prologue and epilogue of the   ''Project Gutenberg''   along with the book's text?

Wouldn't it be a lot simpler to have a simple (and complete) text file to download   [with no (de-)assembly, editing, or text massaging required]?

It seems the original task author used the regexp \w+ in the Clojure and first  Python examples. Maybe he should expand on what \w+ matches and define it as the meaning of a word for the purposes of the task? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 20:09, 17 August 2017 (UTC)
:\w means [A-z0-9]. This could be extended to include accented Latin characters: [A-z0-9√Ä-√ø]. But this would not change that the answers are wrong. There are 41082 occurrences of the word 'the', not 41036. The text contains for instance "BOOK SECOND--THE FALL". I suspect that the Python and Clojure solutions miss this.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 11:51, 18 August 2017 (UTC)
:They are probably missing the two of the three occurrences of 'the' in:

```txt

"The beds," pursued the director, "are very much crowded against each
other."

"That is what I observed."

"The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the air
can be changed in them."

```
--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 12:01, 18 August 2017 (UTC)

```txt

So long as there shall exist, by virtue of law and custom, decrees of
damnation pronounced by society, artificially creating hells amid the
civilization of earth, and adding the element of human fate to divine
destiny; so long as the three great problems of the century--the
degradation of man through pauperism, the corruption of woman through
hunger, the crippling of children through lack of light--are unsolved;
so long as social asphyxia is possible in any part of the world;--in
other words, and with a still wider significance, so long as ignorance
and poverty exist on earth, books of the nature of Les Mis√©rables cannot
fail to be of use.

```

:They also need to catch the 'the' after century--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 12:06, 18 August 2017 (UTC)


::What I mean is, Nigel, that what constitutes a word for the purposes of this task, needs to be defined. Without such a definition, any definition of a word becomes suspect. It is best that the tasks definition of a word is succinct and defined in such a way as to be reproducible in many languages. "Whatever wordprocessor X defines as a word in its word count" doesn't seem like a good enough description ''for the purposes of a task''. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 15:02, 18 August 2017 (UTC)

:::Really, the only thing at all in question to my mind is, is underscore a letter or not? On the face of it, it seems clear; no, of course not. So should the word "_The" in the text be counted as "_the" or "the"? The \w assertion in PCRE (which most languages use directly or emulate) includes underscore for historical reasons, so "_the" and "the" are counted as different words. On the other hand, does the word "Al√®the" contain any non-letter characters? It is awfully narrow-minded to insist that "if you can't fit it in 7 bits, it ain't a character." That being said, I think disregarding hyphenated words and contractions with embedded apostrophes when counting words is ridiculous too so I added a second version which accounts for them, but it doesn't meet the task requirements as written (hence it being a ''second'' version). --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 23:44, 18 August 2017 (UTC)
::::For the purposes of this task, which requires the top 10 words, defining a word as [A-z0-9√Ä-√ø]+ works well and gives the same answers as Perl6 (41088 for the and 14596 for a). Obviously Nigel's is one word, but it would require a lot of possession to promote the single character s into the top 10 words.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 13:23, 19 August 2017 (UTC)

==Using Microsoft Word 2010 to count words==
I opened this task with MS Word 2010 and asked it to count the occurrences of 'the' (all word forms English). It thinks there are 41082.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 13:17, 17 August 2017 (UTC)

This article is cited in the task description, it is not freely available. Apparently it is 10 pages of PASCAL. McIlroy's unix response is available. I've added a reference to the task description. When run it produces:

```txt

:FWIW, The article cited is not free on the ACM website, but it is free from the Princeton CS (Donald Knuth) site. Just type "Programming pearls: a literate program" into Google and press "I'm feeling lucky".
:Also, that UNIX shell script example is already on the task page. It was one of the first ones added. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 17:41, 23 August 2017 (UTC)

::Thanks for the reference. The Unix example on the page does not acknowledge that it is McIlroy's solution. Reading Knuth's version it is clear that it would also have given 41089 as the answer. My point is that the task description relies on these two articles, both of which return 41089 as the answer when applied to the mandated test input, and examples in Clojure and Python which both give 41036 as the answer. I think that the answer should be 41088. This can be explained:
:::The Python and Clojure examples are wrong;
:::The references were never designed to be run using Unicode, which apparently traces it's origins to 1987, but I don't think was widely used before the late 90's.
:::The task author has never run the cited references using the mandated input.
::::The task's description has been updated so as to give freedom for example writers.  McIlroy's solution has been more explicitly acknowledged as having come from the cited article in the history. --[[User:Kentros|Kentros]] ([[User talk:Kentros|talk]]) 01:42, 31 August 2017 (UTC)
::The original author does not seem to be taking any further interest in this task. Perhaps you would like to update the description and mark the Clojure and Python examples as wrong to resolve this.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 13:41, 25 August 2017 (UTC)
:::The original author apologies profusely for not elaborating sooner.  I've updated the description, and I think I've addressed each concern. --[[User:Kentros|Kentros]] ([[User talk:Kentros|talk]]) 01:38, 31 August 2017 (UTC)

::Knuth's paper clarifies another issue 'Let us agree that a word is a sequence of one or more contiguous letters; ‚ÄúBentley‚Äù is a word, but ain't isn‚Äôt'.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 14:26, 25 August 2017 (UTC)

::: That's a lot of good detective work, but if the task leaves the definition of what a word is up to the example writer, then the Python  can't be wrong. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 17:38, 25 August 2017 (UTC)

::::The task defines a word as a sequence of contiguous letters (as in McIlroy's solution) without defining what a letter is. How about leaving it up to the sample writer what a letter is? Samples could then use the Unicode definition or the ASCII definition (or even some other character set) as convenient? --[[User:Tigerofdarkness|Tigerofdarkness]] ([[User talk:Tigerofdarkness|talk]]) 18:09, 25 August 2017 (UTC)

:::::One could for a laugh but not seriously. For a laugh I asked MS Word to open the mandated input using US-ASCII. It then thinks the book is Les MisC)rables. Knuth defined the task assuming it was going to read US-ASCII, and clearly defines what a letter is in that context. It makes no sense to write a task for US-ASCII (e.g. Unix on the task page) and then run it on an example in UTF-8. Obviously an alternative is to mandate an example written in US-ASCII--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 10:32, 26 August 2017 (UTC)

::::::The task as currently defined does not specify what a letter is. I suggested a definition that would allow both the "classic" (pre-RC) solutions and the new Python etc. samples to be accepted. --[[User:Tigerofdarkness|Tigerofdarkness]] ([[User talk:Tigerofdarkness|talk]]) 12:31, 26 August 2017 (UTC)

:::::::I agree that freedom to choose is the best, so I'm going with your suggestion, Tigerofdarkness.  Thanks! --[[User:Kentros|Kentros]] ([[User talk:Kentros|talk]]) 01:27, 31 August 2017 (UTC)
