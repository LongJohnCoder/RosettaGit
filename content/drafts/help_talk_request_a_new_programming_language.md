==Prolog==
Hello,
I would like to see Prolog as a language of rosettacode so if it goes in,  i'll give some example such as making a hash with two arrays
(it's in swi-prolog, for sicstus include list module)
: I moved the programming example to [[Creating a Hash from Two Arrays]]. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 14:36, 11 November 2007 (MST)

==MUMPS==
I would like to see MUMPS as a language of rosettacode. It is a general purpose language, so I expect most of the examples here have applicability. [[User:DavidWhitten|DavidWhitten]]

==Inform==
To anybody who wants to see Inform examples: are you interested in Inform 6 or Inform 7? They're quite different languages. â€”[[User:Underscore|Underscore]] 12:09, 7 May 2009 (UTC)
: Then enter them as two different languages.  Though it'll face some of the same confusion as VB vs VB.Net, or ANSI BASIC vs QuickBASIC.  --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 08:27, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

== Various flavors of (Visual) BASIC ==

I notice that both VBA and Visual Basic 6 are listed. As pointed out, VB already exists. VBA is a superset of VB -- or, perhaps more appropriately, VB is an implementation of VBA. What this means is that "Visual Basic" covers both "Visual Basic 6" and "VBA". There is no need for seperate entries for either of those languages. (If you're programming VBA under Excel, that's a special-purpose version of VBA. If you're writing in VB6, that's a general-purpose version of VBA.)

I vote that those two entries be removed from this list, and any place that has them listed seperately from Visual Basic be merged in. (Any VB examples I post are actually written and tested in Excel... but only because I'm not allowed to install VB on this machine.)

On a similar, and yet unrelated note, I need to add PowerBASIC. I'm working on the category entry, but I don't think I'll have it done before I go home for the weekend (and no internet access @ home, sigh). I'm going to upload what I've got, and if anyone else wants to finish it before I get back to it Monday, have a ball. (It needs at least three entries, one for each language variant.)

: (The above was from me; I forgot to sign it... I was pretty tired by the end of Friday.)

: I finished adding the pages for the various PB versions. I realize that it's a niche language, but it's my language of choice... for DOS & Windows, anyway. (I ''wish'' they'd release a Linux version...) Now I'd like to add language highlighting (it's not 100% compatible with "normal" BASIC ''or'' Visual Basic). I'm willing to do the work if the server side stuff is easy. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 20:52, 10 August 2009 (UTC)
::For adding a new language, see the last two comments here: [[Rosetta_Code:Village_Pump/Syntax_Highlighting#Relationship_Between_Rosetta_Code_and_GeSHi]] --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:59, 10 August 2009 (UTC)
::: Thanks for the link. I grabbed GeSHi, and I'll be sending the code to Short Circuit tomorrow... probably. (Gotta get home so I can mash up my Ultraedit wordlist, and make sure it's correct enough.) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 00:50, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

It's been 2 years, and the VB6 & VBA entries are still on this page. I'm removing them both from this page; VB6 is part of [[:Category:Visual Basic]] and doesn't need its own page, and [[:Category:VBA]] was created in April 2010. (The PB highlighter never happened, but that's a worry for a different day.) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 07:13, 8 October 2011 (UTC)

==Prograph==
I'm putting this here more as a reminder to myself that I want to create this one -- but if someone else beats me to it, fine. (For anyone who's never heard of this, see [[wp:Prograph|the Wikipedia entry for Prograph]].) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] ([[User talk:Eriksiers|talk]]) 05:53, 11 February 2016 (UTC)
