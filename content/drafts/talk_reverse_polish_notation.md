== Dup? ==
This seems like a duplicate of http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Parsing/RPN_calculator_algorithm to me.  --[[User:TimToady|TimToady]] ([[User talk:TimToady|talk]]) 20:43, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
:Sorry, couldn't find that page. I do think it is a duplicate. [[User:Elyashiv|Elyashiv]] ([[User talk:Elyashiv|talk]]) 17:50, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

:I've marked the page as duplicate. The current 5 examples should be easy to merge with the ones on [[Parsing/RPN_calculator_algorithm]].
:*Common Lisp: I've already adapted the code and added it to the other page.
:*D: The version on this page is just a reduced version of the code on the other page.
:*Erlang: Needs to be adapted for the parsing specs. I will ask [[User:Rabuf|Rabuf]] if s/he can do it.
:*Python: Has at least one TypeError and uses IMHO bad style. There is already a working solution on the other page so no big loss.
:*Tcl: A working solution exists already on the other page.
:Thus I suggest to redirect this page to the other one as soon as a working Erlang solution is available. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 21:29, 23 March 2014 (UTC)
::Since we now have an Erlang solution on [[Parsing/RPN_calculator_algorithm]], redirecting to it should be fine, isn't it? --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 08:37, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
