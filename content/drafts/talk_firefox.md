The name escapes me, but I believe Mozilla's JS engine has its own name, which is separately available as well. If I could ''remember'' the name, I'd suggest creating a page for that, making that the JS implemenation, and indicating that Firefox uses it. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:44, 23 April 2010 (UTC)
