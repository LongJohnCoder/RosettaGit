There are still some pieces missing for which I'm not as familiar with the process, such as inclusion into the LCT and parameters to the Language template.  Please don't be shy about adding such things to the "More Advanced" sections of the page; I just documented the process as I've seen it evolved to, but I don't know everything. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 21:08, 1 December 2009 (UTC)
