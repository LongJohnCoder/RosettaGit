{{np language}}<code>tr</code> is a standard [[UNIX]] command which takes as arguments two sets of symbols, and processes a data stream converting instances of the first set to the second set. It is a very domain-specific component of the UNIX stream-processing toolchain, and is not Turing-complete.  It is present by default on most UNIX-like systems.
