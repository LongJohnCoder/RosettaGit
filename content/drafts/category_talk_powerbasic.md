=Stubby=
I first marked this page as a stub because I put up what was essentially an incomplete rough draft on Friday. I think it's as finished as it's going to get for now; who decides when it's ''not'' a stub? Me? Short Circuit? "The community"? (If it's me, I vote "now".) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 19:26, 11 August 2009 (UTC)
:If you don't think any more info will be put on here then get rid of it. If someone else doesn't like it they can put it back. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:28, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

== Why a separate category? ==

Why is PowerBASIC specified as a separate language (a category)? After all, it is just one implementation of [[BASIC]].

Other BASIC implementations are listed in the category BASIC Implementations and the examples inserted under BASIC with "works with" tag. This way, the BASIC source can be found where you expect, at letter B, and you can easily compare different implementations.

Note that for example FreeBASIC has at least as many unique features (and incompatibilities) as PowerBASIC has.

:Mostly because there are currently three different versions ([[PB/DOS]], [[PB/CC]], and [[PB/Win]]; a fourth version (PB/Linux) has supposedly been in development for about a decade) that are incompatible to some degree with each other. (It's possible to write code that works unchanged in both PB/Win and PB/CC, but you frequently (often? usually?) need seperate code for PB/DOS.) If it had been possible to use the same source code in all three flavors, I would've just made it a page, but the differences are big enough that I feel that the category is justified. (I had other reasons, but they're minor compared to this.) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 16:08, 12 August 2009 (UTC)
