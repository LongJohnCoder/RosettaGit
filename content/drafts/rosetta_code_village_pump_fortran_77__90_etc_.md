}}
Hi everyone,

I noticed that Fortran setions usually specify something like "works with Fortran 90", or even that code said to be F77 is usung F90 features (even :: or free form !). I'd like to add Fortran 77 code to some tasks, since I like this language a bit ;-) I would create systematic subsections "Fortran 77", "Fortran 90", or "Fortran 2003" or more for code using newer features of the language. My questions are :
* Is it better to create subsections or to add new languages ?
* Is there any problem in adding F77 code to tasks that already have F90 ?

: There's certainly no problem with having both F77 and F90 answers for the same task, so long as it is clear which is which. As to whether it should be subsections or languages… I just don't know. Do the users of the language(s) feel them to be a true continuation of each other or not? (I've not really coded in Fortran for many years, so I don't know what the community feels.) Also, it might be best to keep them as subsections of the overall <tt>Fortran</tt> section, since then you won't have to go through the large number of existing tasks to disambiguate them all! :-) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 12:43, 31 August 2011 (UTC)

::Ok, I'll add subsections then. Thank you ! [[User:Toucan|Toucan]] 13:47, 31 August 2011 (UTC)
