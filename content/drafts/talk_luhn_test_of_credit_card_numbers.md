The luhn test is failing for the MasterCard BIN 2-Series (222100-272099) 

Sample Master Card:

 12/18

: Note that those cards are not scheduled to be released until next month, so there's no way that that should be a valid card number (which is probably a good thing, since you should not be posting real card numbers here).

: But, also, the Luhn test is apparently not used for Diners Club enRoute cards, so there seems to be precedent for the idea of card numbers which don't validate with the Luhn algorithm.

: Anyways, if Mastercard has a different validation routine to be used for their new card series (and since it's not released, it's kind of hard to know how much of what I read about it is accurate), I have not seen it yet. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 08:15, 21 September 2016 (UTC)
