"The tasks cover everything from the mundane Empty Program to the esoteric Towers of Hanoi." -- [[Main Page]]

These examples bother me a bit because neither one is ''practical''; one is a syntactic fine point and the other is a puzzle. (Also, the main page's talk page is protected, else I would have written this here -- is that intentional?)  --[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 18:38, 29 June 2009 (UTC)
: I protected the main talk page ages ago for a couple reasons.  First, it was getting spammed to the deepest rings of template debugging, and, second, when it did get used for RC-specific stuff, it grew way, way, too large. I'm aware that the introductory paragraphs habr problems, and I'd be happy to replace it with something better, if anyone has suggestions.  --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 21:45, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

:: "...from the classic [[Towers of Hanoi]] to the practical [[Walk Directory Tree]]." I don't quite like the word 'practical' in there though. --[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 21:58, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

::: Perhaps “more practical” would be better. —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 11:02, 30 June 2009 (UTC)
