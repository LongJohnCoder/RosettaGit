The '''Bywater BASIC Interpreter''' (a.k.a. ''bwbasic'') is a [[BASIC]] interpreter. It supports a large subset of the [[wp:BASIC#Standards|ANSI Standard for Full BASIC]], including all of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC. Bywater BASIC was written in [[C]], and runs on [[Unix]]-like and [[DOS]]-based systems (including [[Windows]]).

Bywater BASIC can be downloaded from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic/ its Sourceforge project].
