{{Vptopic|topic=Footnotes and references|summary=Technical issues relating to the use of footnotes and references on this wiki.}}

I see that we've got an [[VList#C++|attempt to use references/citations]]; while I generally approve, what do we need to do to make that actually work? Right now it's complaining about {{tmpl|Citation}} being missing, so obviously things aren't yet right. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 09:27, 20 January 2011 (UTC)
