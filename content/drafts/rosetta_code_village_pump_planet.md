I don't know how many of you follow the blog, or noticed that new Planet link in the sidebar, but I'm looking for more RC-community blogs to add.  I'll only add blogs if the blog owner approves, and I strongly prefer blogs of folks involved in RC.  See [[Rosetta Code:Planet]] for details.  Also, there's a section in the planet template for links to other planets.  I'd like to add more planets with links to particular to programming languages and paradigms, if anyone has suggestions. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 07:44, 16 August 2009 (UTC)
