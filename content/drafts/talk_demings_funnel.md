I'd like to add scatter plots for each of the four rules, but can't find a file upload link.  Not sure if it's a permissions issue. Should it be under Toolbox? -- [[User:Danprager|Danprager]]

:OK - I'll defer adding the plots until post-upgrade. -- [[User:Danprager|Danprager]]

Put the standard test data in the task header (instead of referring to a task implementation) and this may be a good candidate for promotion to full task; it's got plenty of implementations, and that's a ''good'' sign indeed. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 11:56, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
