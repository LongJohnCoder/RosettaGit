Which version of lisp does this page refer to?
:This is the same problem we have with [[BASIC]]. I don't really think it refers to any specific version (at least I wouldn't expect it to). There are [[:Category:Lisp Implementations|implementation pages]] that are linked to from here. That's about the best way to handle it that we've come up with and put into use. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 16:43, 12 April 2010 (UTC)
