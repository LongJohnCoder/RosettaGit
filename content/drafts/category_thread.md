{{library}}
Some languages have a library named "thread".

For [[Ruby]] hackers, <tt>require 'thread'</tt> is part of the standard library. It gives more classes to use with threads.

# <tt>Thread</tt> in core language
# <tt>Mutex</tt> in core language for Ruby 1.9, in this library for Ruby 1.8
# <tt>ConditionVariable</tt> in this library
# <tt>Queue</tt> in this library
# <tt>SizedQueue</tt> in this library
