== Caution ==

Note that the SCS is ''not'' a unique solution; if <math>u</math> is <math>ab</math> and <math>v</math> is <math>ac</math>, the SCS is either <math>abc</math> or <math>acb</math>, both of which are correct. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 16:48, 25 May 2013 (UTC)

==Visibility of most formulae damaged by edit of 05:59, 26 August 2016==

Cosmetic edits made to the task page at 05:59, 26 August 2016, including the injection of spaces around expressions in &lt;math&gt; tags, have left most formulae completely invisible to all browsers which display the graphic file version of formulae rather than processing the MathML (this is, in fact, the majority of browsers). The MediaWiki processor does not currently expect such spaces, and generates syntactically ill-formed HTML if they are introduced. Other aspects of these under-tested cosmetic edits may further compound the problem. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 18:43, 21 September 2016 (UTC)
