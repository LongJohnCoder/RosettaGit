== "K3d" is not  a language ==

: "The k3d cad system supports the use of scripts (typically written in python) for its operation."

According to the [http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/Scripting scripting page on the K3D Wiki], scripts for K3D are written in an external language (like Python). Thus I've blanked the page. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 14:29, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
