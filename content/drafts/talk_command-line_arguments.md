= Problems displaying page =

I went to review this page off a link from a category language page.
Firefox 4beta displayed blank.  IE gave a 500 Error.  

I've noticed this with several other pages.

: All works for me (w. Safari). Perhaps it was a transient server issue (the 500 indicates that it might've been). In general, it's better to report such things via the [[Rosetta Code:Village Pump|village pump]] rather than on task talk pages. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 11:25, 25 January 2011 (UTC)
::Thanks - I'll do that in future.  It was broken for several days.  Now it is working.  --[[User:Dgamey|Dgamey]] 02:54, 26 January 2011 (UTC)
::: Thanks to your [http://irclog.perlgeek.de/rosettacode/2011-01-25 dropping in in IRC], Coderjoe and BenBE2 fixed it. I'd thought it was due to the bad spider from the day before yesterday. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 04:54, 26 January 2011 (UTC)
