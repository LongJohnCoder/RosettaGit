==Game Description==
Could you give more description on how the game is played please? Thanks. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 15:23, 19 August 2018 (UTC)

''"The game is won when the   running total   reaches   exactly   21. "''

Is the game then won or lost by the player who made the total equal 21? [[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 14:33, 19 September 2018 (UTC)

:When the task was originally created the description read : "In a game players choose number 1 to 3 and who gets to 21 is win."
:So, when I added my Go entry earlier today, I took it that the winner is the player whose chosen number causes the running total to reach exactly 21.

:AFAICT that's what the authors of the other entries have assumed so I've altered the game description to make it clear that this is the case.--[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 16:09, 19 September 2018 (UTC)
