Heh everybody just <code>exec</code>s some other program, what does this task really have to do with languages? --[[User:Ledrug|Ledrug]] 07:07, 7 July 2011 (UTC)
:I suppose it's example code for how to invoke some semi-random other environment? --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 11:40, 7 July 2011 (UTC)
:My position (and I realize I'm almost alone on RC for this) is that tasks need not demonstrate substantive differences in languages so long as they accomplish or demonstrate something useful, such as contrasting libraries, or simply demonstrating some other principle or solving some problem which is of interest. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:22, 7 July 2011 (UTC)
