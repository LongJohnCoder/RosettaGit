{{implementation|PowerBASIC}}

'''PowerBASIC Console Compiler''' (a.k.a. '''PB/CC''') is the [[Windows]] [[wp:Command-line interface|console (text-mode)]] compiler for [[PowerBASIC]]. It somewhat resembles [[PowerBASIC for DOS]], but instead of console graphics routines, it includes simple window-handling and drawing routines.

While there are some minor differences between PB/CC and [[PowerBASIC for Windows]], for the most part they use the same language.
