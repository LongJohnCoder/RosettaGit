We here at RC have a lot of templates that essentially mean that an example needs attention (ENA). Hopefully this table can help sort things out for inexperienced (or even hardened) users. Usage instructions should be on the template pages for each individual template. Many work with or without arguments.

|-
|[[Template:Broken]]
|This example is seriously broken. It does not even run/compile.
|{{yes}}
|-
|[[Template:Confusing]]
|This example is very hard to understand even though it seems to meet all task requirements.
|{{yes}}
|-
|[[Template:Eff note]]
|This example shows a way of doing things that matches an algorithmic requirement, rather than the idioms of this language. It is probably not as efficient because it does not follow the language's patterns.
|{{no}}
|-
|[[Template:Field attention]]
|This example needs to be looked at by someone who knows more about the academic field it deals with.

|This example looks to meet all task requirements except that it doesn't show the required output.
|{{yes}}
|-
|[[Template:Untested]]
|This example was not tested. It may not work.
|{{yes}}
|-
|[[Template:Wont work with]]
|This example does not work with library/OS/implementation/language X version Y.
