I created a Subbreddit for the site. Once I figure out what's going on with DNS, it will be accessible at [http://reddit.rosettacode.org http://reddit.rosettacode.org], but it's also accessible at [http://www.reddit.com/r/rosettacodeorg/ http://www.reddit.com/r/rosettacodeorg/].

'''Rationales:'''
* This allows people to draw attention to particular pages in an immediate fashion. (Either to promote a new task, draw attention to a particular page, a particular feature, etc.)
* Reddit is a bit better set up for commenting than MediaWiki. I'd point all of the Talk namespaces in that direction, if I could. ( I probably can, but it'd require writing an extension for the purpose. )
* The Recent Changes feed has been moving much more quickly in the past couple months than it ever has before; This makes watching the all of the feed much more difficult, so I need a different way to follow what's happening. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 17:51, 22 January 2010 (UTC)
