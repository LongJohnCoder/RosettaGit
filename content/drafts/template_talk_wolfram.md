== Parameters? ==

Is the use of all the parameters for words a reasonable choice? It might be better to have the first parameter be the target page link name and the second parameter just be the text to use. That would allow the template to be used in many more places (searching for “mathworld” in page text indicates many candidates). The downside is that it will be a little less convenient to use. (There's also a problem with extra spaces being injected in the link name with things as they currently stand; I think that's fixable even if we don't go with my main suggestion.) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 09:17, 4 June 2013 (UTC)

I'm open on this. Wolfram uses CamelCase for web pages... which is worse.  Really its the choice of two evils.  If I were to vote I'd only vote 75% ''keep''.  Search around, and see which is more readable and - based on the outcome - be bold. [[User:NevilleDNZ|NevilleDNZ]] ([[User talk:NevilleDNZ|talk]]) 10:31, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
:If all of the pages there follow the same pattern we can add it to the [[Special:Interwiki|interwiki links table]] (which you might not have permission to view). This would remove the capability to categorize these pages, but if that's not the goal then the interwiki link is an easier solution. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] ([[User talk:Mwn3d|talk]]) 13:48, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
Additionally: it appears that Mathworld is more widely used in RC then Wolfram... a rename may be in order.  [[User:NevilleDNZ|NevilleDNZ]] ([[User talk:NevilleDNZ|talk]]) 10:35, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
