== it should be interesting concerning the drawing of a rocket ship ==
One could easily see how the ASCII drawing of a rocket ship might cause bewilderment for some backward peoples of the renderings as it might appear to be something else.

Of course, one can't do justice in the displaying of the "launching" of a spaceship,   but I was toying with an alternative of showing the   ''USS Enterprise''   flying horizontally (across the screen).     -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 23:24, 5 August 2019 (UTC)

== arbitrary animation should be allowed ==

I think there is no strict rules in this task. Any cosmic ship animation will do the trick as long as:

1) Watcher can see a countdown

2) Watcher can notice ship "engines ON" / "ignition" event

3) Watcher sees ship flying with ''acceleration''

If all three rules are fulfilled then ANY animation fits for the task.
