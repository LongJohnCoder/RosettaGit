==Formatting==
We seem to have one program copied several times which seems wasteful. How about a header with a 'name' of the program, one copy of the source - with line numbers, and then sub-headers with names for each language it works for containing comments on how/what is special to each language. This would be a special format for just for this page though which may cause future problems. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 06:13, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
:There are already colour-coded versions for each language on the original site (e.g. [http://ideology.com.au/polyglot/cobol/ Cobol] and [http://ideology.com.au/polyglot/pascal/ Pascal]). RC's syntax highlighting doesn't work for most cases so there is IMHO no reason to keep eight copies of the same program. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 07:37, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
