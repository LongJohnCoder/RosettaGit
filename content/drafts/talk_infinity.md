==Assumptions and task specifications==

In J, ''the type of the literal constant 1.0'' is boolean, where the type of the literal constant 1.5 is float.  (J specifies that numeric constants are represented in their most compact form, within a certain hierarchy of types.)  So I am changing the main page to better capture what I think was the intent of its author.  --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 15:00, 24 September 2010 (UTC)
