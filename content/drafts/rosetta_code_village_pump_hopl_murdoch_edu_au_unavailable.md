{{Vptopic

|summary=Broken links to HOPL
}}
When I selected the "Lisp on the HOPL" link on http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Lisp http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/findlanguages2.prx?language=Lisp&which=byname responded with a 404 message.  Shortening the URL to http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/ displays an IIS7 Welcome banner page.

Does anyone here at Rosetta Code know the status of the HOPL or how to contact the organization that runs it?

It looks like the site is permanently down (one can't even reach the main page). The last useful entry in the Internet Wayback Machine is [http://web.archive.org/web/20111205165034/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/ from December 5th, 2011]. All other entries up to January 24th, 2013 (the last one) only captured the IIS7 Welcome banner page as mentioned by [[User:NeoPhyte Rep|NeoPhyte Rep]]. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 20:08, 16 January 2014 (UTC)
