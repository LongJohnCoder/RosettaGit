This doesn't seem to be working. It looks like the site thinks this page has no content yet. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:33, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
: It's not.  It seems the call to Parser::AddCategory I added in GeshiCodeTag for the deprecated tag types causes the "this page is in category X" info to be added to the bottom of the page, but doesn't cause the requisite information to be committed to the database.  I don't know exactly what I need to do to fix it; The documentation on MediaWiki's internal API was automagically generated by doxygen, but precious little about structure, code flow and database interaction cycles easily found. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 07:50, 31 January 2009 (UTC)
