==TCL missing upvar/uplevel==
I'm an occasional TCL programmer, so was surprised at the ommission of [http://www.dqd.com/~mayoff/notes/tcl/upvar.html upvar]. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 05:11, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
:Probably ought to be done as a separate subsection. —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 05:57, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
::OK, try what's in there. —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:23, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
