So what happens when someone creates a RC page for a language that isn't listed on HOPL? For example I could imagine starting a page about [http://wiki.tcl.tk/62 itcl] (which is to Tcl kinda like C++ is to C) but which isn't listed over there. Just curious...
:It would still link to a search for the language. I don't think there is a way to check whether a page exists for a language on the HOPL so we're basically just hoping. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:26, 5 March 2008 (MST)
It is unfortunate to have the HOPL link not point directly to [http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=1558&language=J the right page], taking J as an example. Instead, it brings up a list of roughly one hundred unconnected languages.  I think the HOPL linking would be better hand-crafted than automated. --[[User:TBH|TBH]] 12:35, 7 March 2008 (MST)
:The J search isn't bad at all. J is right on top...TWICE. It seems to work pretty well for other languages too. If you think it works better to just go right to "the right page" then change the template. I don't think the HOPL is set up very well at all though and I'm not too concerned with it. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 14:57, 7 March 2008 (MST)

It looks like HOPL is down --[[User:Hajo|Hajo]] ([[User talk:Hajo|talk]]) 17:08, 26 October 2014 (UTC)

Also, it would be nice to present a link to an alternative, e.g.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages HOPL: History_of_Programming_Languages]
