Programming tasks are problems that may be solved through programming.  
When such a task is defined, Rosetta Code users are encouraged to solve them using as many different languages as they know.  
The end goal is to demonstrate how the same task is accomplished in different languages.

These are the Programming Tasks that have been defined and solved.  
Feel free to add solutions in languages not already included.  

The [[:Category:Simple]] is a small subset with only "really simple" tasks,
like "Hello World", and demonstrations of basic language-features. 

The [[:Category:Draft Programming Tasks]] is a list of tasks, some of which are just awaiting more implementations before they can be promoted to tasks. 
Others may well have problems, (check their discussion and history pages).

Read the [[Rosetta Code:Add a Task|guidelines]] on creating new tasks.  
If you need help, check the [[Category talk:Programming Tasks|discussion for this page]].
