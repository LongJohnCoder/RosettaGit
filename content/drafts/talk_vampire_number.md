==26 numbers==
Shouldn't the first 26 vampire numbers be printed? The trailing zeros condition excludes 126000 = 210 * 600, which is the first number that breaks only the third condition.--[[User:Choroba|Choroba]] ([[User talk:Choroba|talk]]) 22:13, 16 August 2013 (UTC)

: I agree, that would test one of the exclusion rules.     -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 22:06, 25 October 2018 (UTC)
