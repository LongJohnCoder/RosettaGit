I don't like this <nowiki><br clear=all></nowiki> business (and the related "clear:both;" style). It looks really bad with the new skin:

Either it needs to be fixed in the new skin or we need to stop using it. The <nowiki>
```txt
</nowiki> boxes don't even overlap the div boxes in the new skin. If you haven't yet, try the new skin (My Preferences -> Skin -> Rosetta). --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 17:59, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
: But it was looking absolutely crap before with the default skin. Saying "but new users ought to first switch to a different skin" is kind of missing the whole damn point. Us regulars aren't the people for whom the look-and-feel needs to be optimized. (Perhaps the problem is reconstruable as a bug in the new skin...) —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 22:26, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
::I never suggested that all new users switch to a new skin. I was under the impression that the Rosetta theme was to be the default once it was "done". It may very well be a bug in Rosetta but the [[User:Qrush|guy who did most of the development]] is off doing more important things. I don't know who can fix it now especially because Short Circuit seems to be very busy. I'd really like it to get done and become the default because I think it looks better and a lot of work was put into it. Plus it'd be nice if we could make our website look like ''our'' website. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 23:26, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
::: BTW, Rosetta looks poor under Safari/OSX unless I make the window extremely wide. Probably something to do with font availability, but I've no time to debug today… —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:56, 24 June 2009 (UTC)
: It's possible (even likely) that I may have messed up MonoBook in my early workings with the skins over a year ago.  And development progress of the Rosetta skin aside, it needs to work in MonoBook; That skin is the most familiar to anyone who's used a MediaWiki-based site.
: As soon as I can (work's picking up again), I'll do a full replacement upgrade of MediaWiki, rather than the in-place upgrades I've done up to this point.  That'll resolve any potential latent problems with corruption of the MonoBook skin.  Then we'll see what can be done.  I also need to get some volunteers with time on their hands that I can actively delegate some administration, organization and infrastructure work, so I can focus more on adding new functionality and less on maintaining and fixing old. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 23:12, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
::It doesn't really look that bad in MonoBook, but neither does the problem that it tries to fix. I just don't understand it. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 23:26, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
:::It boils down to a matter of taste and strength of preference.  Those are the breaks in web design. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 03:33, 24 June 2009 (UTC)
