{{library}}{{toolkit}}'''AWT''' or '''Abstract Windowing Toolkit''' is a graphics and windowing library made by [[Sun Microsystems]] for [[Java]]. It provides easily reproducible constructs for things like buttons, text areas, and menus. It also can handle [[GUI]] events and user events (keyboard, mouse, drag-and-drop). Layout managers are also available to aid GUI construction. It has been effectively replaced with [[Swing]], which updated AWT's look and feel.
