{{stub}}{{feature|Programming paradigm}}
Tacit programming is programming where the arguments are state-free and are not explicitly referenced.

(For comparison purposes: arguments typically are not explicitly referenced in stack based languages -- however, in most stack based languages arguments are stateful, in the sense that you need to access them differently after every push or pop or whatever.)
