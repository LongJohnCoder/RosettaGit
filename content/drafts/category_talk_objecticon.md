== Note to ObjectIcon contributors ==
I haven't delved into the differences beyond the surface.  Some of the differences are obvious and interesting; others, like IO, suggest that Icon/Unicon code would not run without modification.  It may be trivial like an include/import or much more, I just can't say.  Keep the code variants together and show us.  Thanks. --[[User:Dgamey|Dgamey]] 17:56, 17 December 2011 (UTC)
