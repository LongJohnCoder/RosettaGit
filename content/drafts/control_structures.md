[[Category:Encyclopedia]]'''Control structures''' are features of programming languages that influence the code flow. Examples of control structures are:
*loops, which repeat sections of code
*conditions, which selectively execute sections of code
*exceptions, which help in error handling and avoid causing more problems when there is another problem
*jumps (a.k.a. "branches" or "gotos"), which explicitly and usually unconditionally set the next instruction to be executed by the program

Examples of these structures can be found on the following pages:

* [[Conditional Structures]]
* [[Flow Control Structures]]
* [[Loop Structures]]
* [[Exceptions]]
* [[Help:Orphaned code]]
