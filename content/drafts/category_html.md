'''HTML''' stands for '''HyperText Markup Language'''. It is used mostly on web pages and in emails as encoding for text description. It provides support for text descriptions like links, styles (bold, italics, colors, etc.), tables, and pictures among others. HTML should not be confused with XHTML, which is extended from [[:Category:XML|XML]] and HTML.
