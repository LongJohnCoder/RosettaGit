Perhaps this task would be of wider interest (say people who don't have an ancient IBM mainframe in their basement) if it was defined as create a tape archive and referred to [http://www.fileformat.info/format/tar/corion.htm the format for unix tar].--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] 12:26, 26 October 2012 (UTC)
:Agreed. I don't see the point in just writing a program that writes to /dev/tape as it would write any other file. That's like having separate tasks for ''writing a file to hard drive'', ''writing a file to usb disk'', ''writing a file to SD card''... Apart from some ancient or very specific hardware, it's an OS matter, not a language one. [[User:Arbautjc|Arbautjc]] ([[User talk:Arbautjc|talk]]) 20:42, 8 February 2016 (UTC)
