[http://freeglut.sourceforge.net FreeGLUT] is a free-software/open-source alternative to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library.

GLUT (and hence FreeGLUT) takes care of all the system-specific chores required for creating windows, initializing OpenGL contexts, and handling input events, to allow for trully portable OpenGL programs.

FreeGLUT is released under the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License X-Consortium license].
