In the first example, are we trying to find (b2 - b1) where b2 = 45 and b1 = 20?
Isnâ€™t b2-b1 20? (not -20 like everyone has returned?)

: Not everyone.   Out of seven solutions (eight outputs), only one showed a negative value for the first example. 
: I assume you meant '''25''', not '''20'''.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 14:41, 19 December 2016 (UTC)
