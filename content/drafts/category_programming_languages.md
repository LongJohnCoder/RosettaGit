A programming language is a symbolic representation of a specification for computer behavior.

A side-by-side comparison of many of the languages on Rosetta Code can be seen [[Language Comparison Table|here]].

These are the programming languages that are mentioned throughout Rosetta Code.
If you know a language not listed here then [[Rosetta Code:Village Pump/Suggest a language|suggest]] or [[Rosetta Code:Add a Language|add]] it.


;Note:

Because this category is used for automated administration, it should contain only categories that represent individual languages, not groups of languages.
