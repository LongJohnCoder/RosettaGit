==Stale SMW Table==
The content at the bottom of the page (an embedded Semantic MediaWiki query result) is stale. Is there a way to stop this from happening? –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 11:27, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
: Its content gets cached same as most content on the site; it should clear out over the 15 minute cache lifetime. Optionally, if you have access to the 'purge' tab, you can manually refresh it. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:21, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
:: It's not getting flushed automatically; it seems to be assuming that the ''rendered'' content of the page only changes when the page itself changes (or any template it refers to) but the SMW query isn't such a thing. (It's about 15 ''hours'' since at least one edit that should have changed the results of the query; more have happened since then too.) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 15:29, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
::: I just hit 'refresh' on the page. Is it still not working? I'm showing "Language page links" as being at the top of the list right now, with a mod date of 16 Nov 2010 15:25:44. (Hm. I need to get TZ info added to that format somehow.) --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 15:37, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
