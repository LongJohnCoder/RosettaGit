== Kinda messy ==

I just wanted to use RC to check whether Python has a "while"-type statement and what the syntax is. I figured this would be the place to start looking. As far as I can tell, it is not. The closest I came was going through "Basic language learning" which gets me to a sub-category "control structures" in the task description of which I find a link to "loop structures" which informs me that it is a "former task" and that I should now look for "Iteration" tasks. Which, in turn, do not appear to exist, or at least not on this page or on a page linked from here. To me, at least, this all looks confused and disorganized.

: Nothing is perfect, but my path was: Basic Language Learning &rarr; Iteration &rarr; Loop/While. While, for and so on are "control structures", but first they are iterations; so the old path gave you to Flow Control Structures, which points to Loop Structures, which was the page holding loop structures in general, it is kept since some iterations still might be uncategorized (if you look at Iteration, you see Loop/While, Loop/For and similar... not all Loop Structures fit those categories) or code still need to be moved. It's a wiki, nothing happens automagically. --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 09:07, 15 September 2009 (UTC)
:I had wanted to see if we could get the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CategoryTree category tree extension] installed a long time ago. Maybe that would help. For this particular case, one of the best things to do would be to finish the migration of the old [[Loop Structures]] task. That doesn't seem to be getting a lot of attention from people who understand the examples that are left, though. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 17:32, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

I think this page should be entitled "Solutions by Programming Category", because the list is by category, rather than by task.

It might also be useful to add a tasks by category link to this page in the left hand main menu of rosetta code.

:As far as I can tell, that categorization that I tried to do a long time ago didn't really work. It pretty much only made sense to me. I don't think these categories are ready for primetime. We shouldn't give it a link until we're sure it'll be useful for newer users. We need to make sure the categorizations make sense and also rmove the old ones that don't. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:44, 7 May 2011 (UTC)

There is a discussion of category grouping over at [[Rosetta_Code:Village_Pump/Grouping_tasks]]  --[[User:Dgamey|Dgamey]] 11:18, 18 May 2011 (UTC)

Would this be better named as "Solutions by Programming Category", rather than "Solutions by Programming Task"? --[[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 20:13, 5 June 2011 (UTC)
: Yes. Originally, this category was organizationally identical to [[:Category:Programming Tasks]], but evolved to what it is now. Sadly, MediaWiki doesn't support redirects in categories, and there are a ''lot'' of outside-world links to this page, so renaming the category properly is non-trivial. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 23:16, 5 June 2011 (UTC)
::We could probably get most of them by editing the link in {{tmpl|task}}. I haven't looked in to any other direct links. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 00:45, 6 June 2011 (UTC)
::: It's the outside-world links I'm mostly worried about. I was passing out links to this category for a couple years. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:08, 6 June 2011 (UTC)
::MediaWiki does support redirects in categories: [[:Category:Basic]]. It doesn't support members of redirected categories being placed in the new destination category (you may have seen me correct some headers from "Javascript" to "JavaScript" even though Category:Javascript is redirected to Category:JavaScript). The members of the categories we can fix in {{tmpl|task}}. The external links we can fix with a redirect. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 17:14, 14 June 2011 (UTC)
