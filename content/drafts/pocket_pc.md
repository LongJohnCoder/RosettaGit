A '''Pocket PC''' (abbreviated '''P/PC''' or '''PPC''', also known by [[Microsoft]] as a "[[Windows]] [[wp:Windows Mobile|Mobile Classic]] device") is a hardware specification for a handheld-sized computer ([[wp:personal digital assistant|personal digital assistant]]) that runs the "Windows Mobile Classic" [[:Category:Operating Systems|operating system]]. It has ''some'' of the capabilities of modern desktop PCs.

With the advent of Windows Mobile 6, Microsoft dropped the name Pocket PC in favor of a new naming scheme. Devices without an integrated phone are called "Windows Mobile Classic devices" instead of Pocket PCs. Devices with an integrated phone and a touch screen are called "Windows Mobile Professional devices", and devices without a touch screen are called "Windows Mobile Standard devices".
