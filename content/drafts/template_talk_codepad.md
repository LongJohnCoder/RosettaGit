Should the ability to link to Codepad be moved into part of the main language template? --[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]]
: Codepad has support for a limited number of languages; It shouldn't be part of the main language template unless it supports all the languages the main language template is used on.  I suspect you can imagine the likelyhood of that. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 00:54, 16 August 2009 (UTC)
::It could be made optional like the various characteristics-of-the-language parameters. And having it in the language template has the advantage that the Codepad link will be in a guaranteed standard place across all language pages. --[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 01:04, 16 August 2009 (UTC)
