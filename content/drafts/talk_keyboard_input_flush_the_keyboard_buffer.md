== C is blank? ==

Does that mean the input is automatically flushed? Explanatory text or a real example is needed. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 21:39, 28 November 2011 (UTC)

: At 20 September, new user Chunyun [http://rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Keyboard_input/Flush_the_keyboard_buffer&diff=120939&oldid=119280 tried to fix the example] but instead [http://rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Keyboard_input/Flush_the_keyboard_buffer&diff=120946&oldid=120939 blanked the code]. The previous code was entirely wrong, so the blank example was not any worse. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:53, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
