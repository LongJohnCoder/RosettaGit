{{Vptopic
|topic=Automate Village Pump
|summary=Requesting a bot for managing the Village Pump
}}
A bot needs to be created to organize and maintain the Village Pump, so that old topics drop to the bottom of the page and new and active topics rise to the top. (a la Digg or Reddit, but without up/downvoting.)  MediaWiki has problems when pages get too large, so it needs to be able to handle archiving old discussions.

My current thought is that all VP topic pages get tagged with a category, so that the bot can easily find them.  It would then find the ones that were most recently edited, and have those tasks appear in the VP page. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 05:48, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
