"Run BASIC" is not a language that I know of. The language is "BASIC". I would sort it earlier. Call it:
"BASIC (Run)" if needs be.  Do others agree? Or did I not get the memo?

:Hi, you need to sign your talk page entries. We don't do BASIC BBC, so I would think Run BASIC is fine myself. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 21:08, 25 June 2013 (UTC)

::I think the problem is simply that [[User:RobinLRandall|RobinLRandall]] (who posted the original question) is apparently unaware of the language Run BASIC, and didn't actually read the page, which discusses what Run BASIC is, and links to both the WP page and the RB home page. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] ([[User talk:Eriksiers|talk]]) 03:27, 26 June 2013 (UTC)
