== Bug in template? ==
Something odd is going on with this template; it's inserting the link twice… –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 13:50, 29 July 2010 (UTC)
: My error. Fixed. See [[Rosetta Code:Village Pump/Semantic MediaWiki]]. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 16:14, 29 July 2010 (UTC)
:: Thanks. (And very interesting; pity I'm stuck with doing work rather than playing with this stuff…) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:34, 30 July 2010 (UTC)

== C# issue ==

The link redirects to C. Should the exception added to this template? --[[User:Mielikki|Mielikki]] ([[User talk:Mielikki|talk]]) 16:49, 3 March 2019 (UTC)
:There is already a workaround. See for instance this edit: http://rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=User:Emilioplatzer&diff=prev&oldid=277995
