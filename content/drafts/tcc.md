{{implementation|C}}
TCC — Tiny C Compiler — is a compiler of [[C]] designed to be used in embedded environments. It only generates code for the x86 and x86-64 architectures.

There is a [[Tcl]] extension that embeds TCC to enable putting C inside Tcl scripts. (See [http://wiki.tcl.tk/20123 the Tcler's Wiki] for more details.)
