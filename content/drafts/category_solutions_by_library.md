[[Category:Solutions]][[Category:Static Category Cache]]

'''Libraries''' are software which extend the functionality of a programming language, usually by providing an [[API]] to complete a specific task.  Different languages may have their own name for libraries, such as [[Perl]] modules, or [[Java]] packages.

Many programming examples on Rosetta Code make use of libraries.
