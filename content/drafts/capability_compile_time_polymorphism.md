{{stub}}{{capability}}The ability to call different functions depending on the static type of an object (i.e. the type derived from the declaration of the pointer or reference which refers to the object). This capability applies only to statically typed languages. Compile time polymorphism can e.g. be implemented through overloading or through implicitly resolved generic functions (like C++ templates).
