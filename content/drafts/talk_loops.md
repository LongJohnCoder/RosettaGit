I just want to make sure of your intentions...are you trying to replace [[Loop Structures]]? If you are, you should pull some code from there too. Also should this just be a category? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 06:39, 11 April 2008 (MDT)

Shouldn't this be the parent page for the other [[loop]] pages? Also many of these aren't really loops (map). Would [[Iteration]] be a better name? --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 09:49, 12 April 2008 (MDT)

This seems like a good pattern to follow for other related pages, like [[Array]], [[File system]], [[Linked list]], and [[Doubly-linked list]]. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 09:49, 12 April 2008 (MDT)
:I agree that it should at least be a category. "Iteration" may be a better name for it too (with "loops" still redirecting to it). --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 10:19, 12 April 2008 (MDT)
