Biferno and Bifernod are currently showing up in main rather than as language pages. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 19:31, 19 September 2010 (UTC)
:I'm not sure what that means. Bifernod is in the main namespace which seems to be how we've done implementations (I use [[QuickBasic]]/[[BASIC]] as an example for that), and Biferno has a category page and a redirect from the main namespace. They seem to be set up correctly. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 22:09, 19 September 2010 (UTC)
