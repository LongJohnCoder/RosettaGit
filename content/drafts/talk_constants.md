==Duplicate?==
This looks like it's already covered by the literals tasks ([[Literals/String]], [[Literals/Floating point]], and [[Literals/Integer]]). It is also partly covered by [[Variables]]. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 02:46, 31 May 2011 (UTC)

Not really. Those tasks appear to be about notation for representation. This task is about named definitions that cannot be overwritten at run time.

(Huh! I don't know whether that makes it any clearer. Maybe I will come up with better wording, after a few nights sleep.)
