Although it's not obvious (to me) how to solve the Interactive Programming task purely within the bounds of any known (to me) implementations of Algol 68, one could in principle use Algol 68 Genie to implement an interface to http://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_algol_online.php but doing so would constitute cheating IMAO.

Genie has a debugging mode but as of Version 2.8 this is not powerful enough to elaborate more than a miniscule subset of A68.

You could, of course, exclude Algol 68 from that task. But how long does it take to compile a small algol 68 program on a modern computer? It might be reasonable to build a shell script which takes a line of code, wraps it in a small program which prints the result, and then compiles and executes that (all of this in a loop)? If not, I think I would just exclude it for now. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 18:08, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

Sure I could do that.  It needn't be restricted to one-liners either if I re-used the technique at [[Call_a_foreign-language_function#ALGOL_68]].  The question is would that be cheating?  I suppose you could take the line that if I've cheated once I may as well continue doing so.  In that case, I could implement both solutions but where would it end?

: Well, ultimately it ends where you decide it ends. But if you want specific advice on a task, I think the talk page for that task would yield more relevant comments (eventually...). --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 17:51, 9 August 2015 (UTC)
