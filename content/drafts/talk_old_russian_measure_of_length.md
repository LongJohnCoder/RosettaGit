== Language? ==
At the moment, the task does not show how to do a conversion and the only example seems hard to understand.

Suggestion: How about a more generic task where, given a table of conversions between units and their SI unit the program then converts between asked for units? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 21:37, 9 January 2013 (UTC)

: You have in mind is a custom table in the program and working with it, or the allocation table as a separate part of the program? Such an option is reasonable.
: In the above code, I have to make a table in a separate array somewhat complicated, resource constraints affect the machine, so the program immediately calculates with the coefficients. [[User:Русский|Русский]]

:: Is it a task requirement to use coefficients, or are you allowed to define a table of all the units in terms of, for instance, meters? [[User:Fwend|Fwend]] 15:35, 15 February 2013 (UTC)
::: I think it should be left to the programmer. [[User:Русский|Русский]] 19:54, 26 February 2013 (UTC)

== Reference? ==
Could you provide an authoritative reference to the size of these units?  I know that old units are not usually standardized well, but if they are, I'd like to add them to my programming language [[Frink]], which is all about doing conversion of units of measure.  Its standard data file contains thousands of units, but not these!  --[[User:Eliasen|Eliasen]] ([[User talk:Eliasen|talk]]) 20:41, 15 January 2014 (UTC)
: Of course, the measures to standardize national metrology were accepted. See the decree "On the Russian system of weights and measures" on October 11, 1835 or the "Regulations on Weights and Measures" on June 4, 1899 (is in the second and third "Complete Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire").
