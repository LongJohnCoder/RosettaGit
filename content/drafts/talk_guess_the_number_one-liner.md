== Vote for deletion ==

There is nothing added by this task that isn't already covered by [[Guess_the_number]]. Pointless restrictions on code formatting lead to obfuscation and code compression that Rosetta Code specifically discourages, and completely prevents some languages from participating; Piet and Fōrmulæ come to mind immediately. There is no restriction on line length, so the task is pretty much "Copy the program from [[Guess_the_number]] but take out all of the new-line characters." Vote for deletion. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 10:18, 8 August 2019 (UTC)

:Agree totally. It's really inviting folks to rewrite the [[Guess_the_number]] task in 'code golf' style which is not something we want to encourage on RC.--[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 12:18, 8 August 2019 (UTC)

:: Same here.   Rosetta Code isn't the place for code golf contests.   What is the point of entering (almost) unreadable computer programs?     -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 19:01, 8 August 2019 (UTC)

::: I agree, although if it was a task only for line-sensitive languages, it would be slightly more interesting - like the Calendar For Real Programmers Task, where the source must be in upper-case and so requires some sort of pre-processor for case-sensitive languages. --[[User:Tigerofdarkness|Tigerofdarkness]] ([[User talk:Tigerofdarkness|talk]]) 19:37, 8 August 2019 (UTC)
