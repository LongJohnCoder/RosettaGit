Is this really its own language, or an implementation of [[Object Pascal]]? --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 12:53, 4 December 2007 (MST)
: AFAIK the term "Object Pascal" is only used for Delphi. The Delphi object model is different from the Turbo Pascal object model (although I think TP objects are still supported in Delphi; however I'm not sure about that, because I never have used Delphi). Also note that prior to version 5.5, Turbo Pascal didn't have objects at all. --[[User:Ce|Ce]] 14:12, 4 December 2007 (MST)
::All the more reason to consider Turbo Pascal an implementation rather than a language in its own right.  I propose moving examples without objects to [[Pascal]] (Compiler: Turbo Pascal <5.5) and examples with non-Delphi objects to [[Object Pascal]] (Compiler: Turbo Pascal >5.5) and moving [[:Category:Turbo Pascal]] to [[Turbo Pascal]].  I guess the question is now whether [[Delphi]] is its own language or an implementation of [[Object Pascal]]. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 08:33, 5 December 2007 (MST)
