Do you think we could make a table of features for libraries like the language one? It wouldn't be as large. I was thinking just a list of languages it is used for, the library website, and supported operating systems? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 13:49, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

Use [[Template:Library beta]] for ideas. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 14:12, 11 June 2009 (UTC)
