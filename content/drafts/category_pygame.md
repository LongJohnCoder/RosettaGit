[[wp:Pygame]] is a highly portable set of python modules built on the [[SDL]] library. 

It is designed specifically for writing games, but it is also useful 
for simple GUI drawing and animations.

Pygame is a library for cross-platform game development and depends 
on the SDL multimedia library (SDL_mixer) for its audio playback. 

SDL_mixer supports any number of simultaneously playing channels of 16 bit stereo audio, 
plus a single channel of music, mixed by the popular MikMod MOD, Timidity MIDI, 
Ogg Vorbis, and SMPEG MP3 libraries.
