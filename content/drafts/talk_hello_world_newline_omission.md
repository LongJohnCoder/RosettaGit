== C undefined ==

Is the comment after the C example referring to IEC 9899:1999? It only says "whether the last line of a text stream requires a new-line is implementaion-defined", I didn't see where it said "shall be a new-line", or what happens "or else".  Clarify a little? --[[User:Ledrug|Ledrug]] 15:45, 4 October 2011 (UTC)
