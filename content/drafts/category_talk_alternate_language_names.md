==C sharp/F Sharp==
Now we have a case problem. Should we go with uppercase or lowercase S? We should be consistent between languages (in case J#, A#, or P# show up). What will the bot so if we put [[:Category:C sharp]] into this category? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:32, 26 April 2010 (UTC)
:Yes, consistency would be nice. Don't put [[:Category:C sharp]] here, since, at least for the moment, "C sharp" is the official name. I'd put [[:Category:C Sharp]] here, but it's empty, so I guess nobody's making that particular mistake. â€”[[User:Underscore|Underscore]] ([[User talk:Underscore|Talk]]) 20:20, 26 April 2010 (UTC)
