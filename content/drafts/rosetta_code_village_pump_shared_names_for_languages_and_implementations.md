What's the appropriate way to make implementation pages when the implementation shares a name with the language (e.g. for [[Inform 7]])? --[[User:Mr2001|Mr2001]] 22:08, 2 November 2010 (UTC)

: I say that we should just keep them the same for now (for one thing, it's a vastly common case, especially for less-common languages), having the page note that it is both a language and an implementation of the language. After all, this is a wiki; we don't need to avoid multiple-inheritance… ;-) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:59, 3 November 2010 (UTC)
:: [[:Category:Perl]] used to be a shared implementation/language page. I don't remember why it was changed. Excessive category nesting ''does'' mess with the Semantic MediaWiki queries, though. (SMW collapses categories in queries.) --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 12:16, 3 November 2010 (UTC)
