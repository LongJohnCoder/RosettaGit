{{Vptopic

I've been thinking about building a bot to bridge IRC and the wiki. I've been pondering update frequency, and possibly having wiki-based edits to the channel log page show up in the channel, thereby allowing a delayed-conversation of sorts.  I feel this is somewhat important, since I do a lot of fast thinking and planning about the wiki's architecture on the IRC channel, but the general wiki sometimes only finds out about it once I've implemented the changes.

My current thought is to have the bot update a page on the wiki after ten minutes of inactivity, and perhaps check the talk page for new edits, which it would then paste into the channel, to allow folks in the channel to respond.  A similar mechanism (called MajorNet) used to be used to link dial-up BBS systems' chat rooms. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 04:56, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
