== Purpose? ==
What is the purpose of the page and the link on it?

Is this page a stub, that is meant to be an Encylopedia page (i.e. added to the Encylopedia Category)? Otherwise I'm not sure it belongs here. --[[User:Tikkanz|Tikkanz]] 20:10, 15 February 2010 (UTC)

: It looks like this page was added as a landing spot from the language comparison table (where even a short explanatory sentence would not be appropriate).  I added a bit of content to this page, which hopefully makes sense to people.  --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 17:11, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
