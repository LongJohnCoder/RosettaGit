Welcome to the managed C++ version of the Rosetta Code. It was created in 2015 just for something to do. It was a port from the [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/AVL_tree/C_sharp C#] version of I#. [[User:NNcNannara|NNcNannara]] ([[User talk:NNcNannara|talk]]) 11:01, 13 July 2016 (UTC)

Note that I have a whole class library in managed C++ - it is called The Standard Generic Library. I gave the source code to Bjarne Stroustrup but it is no longer publicly available or supported. Calculus in C# and Java do the same thing.
