== Draft to Task promotion ==

Hey guys, I haven't been around RC in a while.  The draft task approach is new to me.  What separates a draft task to a task? Under what conditions is a draft promoted to a published task?  Do we need to reach consensus on the specification and its clarity on this Talk page first?<BR>--[[User:DanBron|DanBron]] 20:58, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
: It's pretty nebulous. The big thing is that it gives people a few days to provide feedback. After a few days  and a few consistent solutions by different people, someone decides to promote it to {{tmpl|task}}. (Also, welcome back!) --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 03:36, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
:I tried to make some general guidelines [[User:Mwn3d/Personal_policies#Upgrading_tasks_from_.22draft.22|here]]. They aren't hard rules but they're a start I guess. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 05:04, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
::Thanks guys.  From Mwn3d's list, looks like I don't have to anything but wait. Another new thing on RC for me - used to be when someone posted a task, others swarmed on it within hours! <BR>--[[User:DanBron|DanBron]] 12:34, 29 May 2011 (UTC)

::: "''- used to be when someone posted a task, others swarmed on it within hours!''".
::: Owww but its graphical. That always makes me pause :-(

:::: The way I read the task (a couple days ago; haven't finished getting through the RC feed yet to see if it's changed) the GUI component is extra credit. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 13:00, 30 May 2011 (UTC)
::: The only tasks I see get jumped on quickly are ones which don't have any UI, or have trivial UI. Not entirely surprising, because UI is one of the hardest problems in software. :) (It'd be *really* nice to have some skeleton tasks which set up the basics for drawing on a 2D plane. )--[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 13:00, 30 May 2011 (UTC)
:::: Yeah, to be clear, the task is to implement the algorithm.  The GUI is totally optional.<BR> Though it's helpful to have a GUI when writing/debugging the algo.  <small>(Which may be a biased statement, because the task is well suited to J, and both the algo and its visualization represent a very low investment. In other langs the investment in the GUI may overwhelm the effort to build the algo). </small> <BR>-- [[User:DanBron|DanBron]] 14:19, 31 May 2011 (UTC)
