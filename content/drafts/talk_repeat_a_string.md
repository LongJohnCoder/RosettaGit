### task clarification


The goal is to obtain a string, or to print some text X times? --[[User:SenTalker|SenTalker]] 21:28, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

: I took it to mean:
:* a string is already defined  (say, the contents of a variable)
:* repeat that string some number of times
:* optionally show the result

:: I also interpreted that it is the generation of a string (that is a repetition of the input string some specified number of times) that is the goal. Printing the string in a loop would ''not'' be a correct solution, except for languages where doing output is effectively the same as producing an intermediate value (a small minority of languages). â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:30, 29 October 2012 (UTC)
