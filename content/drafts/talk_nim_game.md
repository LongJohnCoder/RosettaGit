I would love for anyone who is interested to make any edits to the description that will make it more readable. I'll also be adding a few more examples before promoting this to a regular task. If you have any examples, feel free to add them - I will be adding Javascript and Python myself, and possibly also C and Java, if I still have a little extra time ;D [[User:Prof Apex|Prof Apex]] ([[User talk:Prof Apex|talk]]) 15:59, 10 April 2019 (UTC)

I think if there are no changes needed to the description text, I will move this to a regular task in a couple days, since there are now a few examples (and even one I didn't write ;D) [[User:Prof Apex|Prof Apex]] ([[User talk:Prof Apex|talk]]) 20:54, 10 April 2019 (UTC)

I'm glad there's already a bit of interest in this!
It should be noted with the REXX version that if the player specifies a number of tokens that is not a multiple of 4, the computer will not win using the same method. Either the number of tokens must be adjusted to a multiple of 4, or a number must be found that divides evenly into the number of tokens, the take limit set to 1 less than that, and the computer take the difference of those numbers instead (if that made any sense at all..)[[User:Prof Apex|Prof Apex]] ([[User talk:Prof Apex|talk]]) 12:28, 11 April 2019 (UTC)

Actually I just remembered a third method - in the event that the number of tokens is not a multiple of 4, the computer can go first, taking #tokens % 4, setting the game up to be unwinnable again for the player.[[User:Prof Apex|Prof Apex]] ([[User talk:Prof Apex|talk]]) 12:34, 11 April 2019 (UTC)
