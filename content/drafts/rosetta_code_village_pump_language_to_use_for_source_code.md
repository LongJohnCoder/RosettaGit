|summary=Discuss what written language, (e.g. English/Russian/French/...), source code entries should be written in.
}}
There are several examples that are written in none-English. I.e. even though the programming language keywords might be in English, the variables and comments are not. An example would be [[Main_step_of_GOST_28147-89#JavaScript|this]] and [[Main_step_of_GOST_28147-89#Glagol|this]]. Currently there are not many such examples so I would like to start a discussion about whether 'we' collectively, want to expand into this area of multi-language support on RC. 
(Forgive me if this has been covered elsewhere - if it has then point out where and I will amend this). --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 23:07, 22 March 2013 (UTC)

: Agree, would look ridiculous, for example, the following code:
<lang>КОЛЬЦО
  ЕСЛИ condition ТО
    action()
  ИНАЧЕ
    exit(); ВЫХОД
  КОН
КОН
```

: Another thing, [[Main_step_of_GOST_28147-89#JavaScript|sample code]] of a language with English keywords I put finished piece, written by me long before that; it can be corrected for clarity. As for the use of non-English words in the code on the English site, I suppose, in some rare cases, it is appropriate. I think any little bit educated person in any country knows Latin, Greek and Cyrillic alphabets and easily read the sections of code that use them.

::I agree with you. I wrote a task description where I used non-english words (Hebrew I think) to count a series - It might just as well have been Greek, but I was bored with the constant use of Greek so looked for something else. See [[Probabilistic choice]] where I used ''aleph beth gimel daleth ...''. 
::Looking at it now, it seems a legitimate use to me. What I think would not work is if someone added code with all the variables and comments in, say, German, for example. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 07:19, 24 March 2013 (UTC)
