== Some severe problems here ==

(1) This needs to be marked as a draft task.

(2) The spec should describe the result rather than the algorithm. For example "Initialise an array of fixed size to zero" is either language specific or ambiguous as a specification (or maybe just not very useful since there are other valid ways of achieving the same end).

(3) This needs some examples.

(4) Finally, the algorithm being described has already been implemented as a task, but the linked page is about something different from what is being described here.

Overall, this sounds like an easy thing to accomplish but the current lack of any working code (and the lack of examples) points at some problems with how this is being conceived. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 21:04, 3 August 2016 (UTC)
