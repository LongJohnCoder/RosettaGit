== [[Standard ML]] typing ==

Standard ML's types are a mix of explicit and implicit. You can explicitly type things if you want, but the language features (and requires) a strong type inference engine so it can usually work out the exact type of everything for you without much assistance. As a language it's interesting particularly because it's mainly about constructive types and a very high degree of genericity. Not quite sure how that maps onto the [[:Category:Typing/Expression|Typing/Expression]] feature classes though; ''they'' need some descriptions of what they mean… —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 14:11, 26 June 2009 (UTC)
:Those categories were just made from the [[Language Comparison Table]]. I'm not exactly sure what "partially implicit" means either, but someone marked it a couple times on the LCT. If you know about any language's features could you add them to the category page of that language? If you get more than 3 or 4 of them, could you put it on the LCT? I just filled in the SML stuff from what I could (kind of) figure out from the WP article. If you think that a language doesn't fit into the categories that are there, make a new one (it ''is'' a wiki, you know). --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 14:24, 26 June 2009 (UTC)
::Standard ML has basically the same typing system as [[OCaml]], which is pretty much the same as in [[Haskell]]. So I would expect all those languages to be listed under the same categories for typing system. --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] 18:33, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

Lately I've been adding [[mLite]] entries. I've been putting them together with [[Standard ML]] under the one category of [[ML]]. At this point there's nothing in the system backing up the use of [[ML]]. Should I continue to merge them? [[mLite]] and [[Standard ML]] are quite similar but do differ markedly from time to time. Should other ML-ish languages get sucked in as well, e.g. [[Caml]] and [[OCaml]], or are they sufficiently different to warrant separate treatment?
