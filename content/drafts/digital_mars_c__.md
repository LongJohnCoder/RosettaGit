{{implementation|C++}}

[[wp:Digital Mars|Digital Mars]] C++ is a free [[:Category:C++|C++]] compiler for [[DOS]] and [[Windows]].

Originally a [[:Category:C|C]] compiler created by [[wp:Datalight|Datalight]], it was sold to [[wp:Zortech|Zortech]], who then added a C++ compiler, calling the result '''Zortech C++'''. [[wp:Symantec|Symantec]] purchased Zortech specifically to get ownership of these compilers, which were eventually acquired by Digital Mars (which is more well-known for creating the [[:Category:D|D programming language]]).

For more information, see [http://www.digitalmars.com/ Digital Mars' website].
