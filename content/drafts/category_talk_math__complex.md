Why the double-colon? Isn't the MediaWiki syntax for subpages a slash? Besides, Math/Complex would also look better.
:This is the correct syntax for name of Perl modules.  The name of the library is actually '''Math::Complex'''. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 11:18, 9 February 2008 (MST)

:So, i use libheader with "Math::Complex" as Perl module name. That's right. I view Math::Complex. That's right too. In category view i prefer same syntax, but only perl modules in one page ([[Perl_modules]]). Another question is URL. xxx/Math/Complex is better URL than xxx/Math::Complex.
