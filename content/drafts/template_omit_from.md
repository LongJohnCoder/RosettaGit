<includeonly>{{#set:omitted from language={{{1}}}}}[[Category:{{{1}}}/Omit]]</includeonly><noinclude>Adds this task to the "Not Considered" list of the Unimplemented tasks by language page. Usage:

 <nowiki>{{omit from|</nowiki>''the language category name''<nowiki>}}</nowiki>

 <nowiki>{{omit from|</nowiki>''the language category name''|''motivation for omitting rather than leaving on the unimplemented tasks list''<nowiki>}}</nowiki>

The second parameter is as yet not used; it exists to formalize the practice of including such reasons, which have previously been done with comments after the template use.

{{template}}</noinclude>
