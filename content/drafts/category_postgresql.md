'''PostgreSQL''' is a free object-relational database server (database management system), released under a flexible [[BSD]]-style license. It offers an alternative to other database systems. Similarly to other [[open source|open-source]] projects such as Apache, [[Linux]], and MediaWiki, PostgreSQL is not controlled by any single company, but relies on a global community of developers and companies to develop it.
