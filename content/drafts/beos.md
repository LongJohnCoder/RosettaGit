[[Category:Operating Systems]]
'''BeOS''' is a single-user multitasking graphical operating system, originally targeted at the BeBox computer, and later adding [[wp:PowerPC|PowerPC]] [[Macintosh|Macintoshes]] and the Intel [[x86 architecture]]. Although it sees little use today, it still retains a small but loyal following.
