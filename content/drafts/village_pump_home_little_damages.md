I've found [[MNumerical Encryption/Decryption]] page, which is not a task nor... I don't know. Anyway, added the header supposing it was mIRC script, and without deeper thought I've recreated the Category mIRC (MIRC); I've redirected it to [[:Category:mIRC Scripting Language]], but then noticed that here the MNumerical non-task page was not listed (of course:D), so fixed the header and... now the redirect is (again?) obsolete. I've not seen a way to delete it.

As I've written also in [[Village Pump:Home/Syntax Highlighting]], trying to fix layout problem because of a warning when using the <nowiki><code></nowiki> tag, I've changed some into tt tag instead; realizing later that it could be a bad idea, since code behaviour maybe will be back to "normal" some day and its usage was more logical than the tt, which is just a "typesetting suggestion"... In case, I will run through my contributions to fix these. --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 00:46, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
: The <nowiki><code></nowiki> deprecation warning will be removed eventually.  If you wanted the behavior of the HTML <nowiki><code></nowiki> tag, just leave it as is, and that behavior will return, once syntax-highlight usage of the tag has been converted to <nowiki><code></nowiki>.
: The mIRC page you came across was written by a fellow student of mine back when I was harassing personal friends to provide content in the very very early days of RC.  IIRC, there's a task somewhere with a mIRC example that uses that script to work.  Perhaps that code can be merged in with the task example. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 06:18, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
:: On second thought, the code should probably be removed, due to the licensing restrictions placed on it. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 06:19, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
:::There are some other weird pages related to that mIRC snippet [[User:Osah|here]]. Any ruling on those? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 13:27, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
