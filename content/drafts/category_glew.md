The [http://glew.sourceforge.net/ OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW)] is a cross-platform open-source C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform.

See the library's home page for licensing details.
