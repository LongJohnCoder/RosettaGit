Loops are control structures that allow sections of code to be executed repeatedly according to the controlling conditions of the loop. There are two types of loops: iterative loops and conditional loops.

This category is about conditional loops. 

Conditional loops test for conditions around the loop, and repeatedly executes a block of instructions whilst the condition is true. Types of conditional loops include [[Loops/While|while]] loops, [[until]] loops, and [[Loops/Do-while|repeat]] loops. Tasks in this category show how conditional loops can be used to accomplish repetitive tasks.
