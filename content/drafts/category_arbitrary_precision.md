[[Category:Mathematical operations]]'''Arbitrary-precision arithmetic''' is a type of calculation that is involves numbers with the number of digits of precision are limited only by the available memory of the system (as opposed to fixed-precision arithmetic, where precision is determined by a fixed number of storage bits used for numbers). Arbitrary-precision arithmetic is sometimes called '''bignum arithmetic''' and is provided natively by some languages (Such as [[Lisp]], [[Haskell]], and [[Rexx]]) and through libraries such as [[:Category:GMP|GMP]] in others.
