==De-golf==
In the Phix Thistlethwaite entry, I have deciphered the original "string data" into d1, d2 and d3, however the precise 
meaning of the latter two remains a bit of a mystery. Any further suggestions/insights would be appreciated, as would 
any other notes on the code in general. (No idea what that 3587708 is either.)
You can also find a working C++ version at https://ideone.com/BbjJdy however my entry has a bit more de-golfing/comments.
