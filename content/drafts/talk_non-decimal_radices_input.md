Hi Tinku, your Autohotkey entry should be in [[Number base conversion]]. This is only for in-built functions. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 08:40, 20 June 2009 (UTC)
: the task says: using the language's built-in facilities ''if possible.'' 

: I thought the tradition was to put in a disclaimer and implement a facility if not builtin.

:Consider merging with [[Number base conversion]]?--[[User:Tinku99|Tinku99]] 13:58, 20 June 2009 (UTC)
Hi, This task was started after Number base conversion to highlight what the languages come with without having to 'roll your own'. It would be better to move all but your first sentence to NBC, then maybe add the handling of decimal. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 15:59, 20 June 2009 (UTC)
: Speaking as the person who started this task, it's there to show language/standard-library built-ins. Yes, any language with string and number handling ought to be able to parse a string to get a number (it's very close to being one of the most basic possible operations outside the core Turing Machine set) but there's also definitely valuable inter-language comparison to be had looking at what is provided to coders by default. â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 22:57, 21 June 2009 (UTC)
