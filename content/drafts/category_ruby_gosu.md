[https://www.libgosu.org/ Gosu] (sometimes written "libgosu" or "libGosu" to distinguish it from the programming language of the same name) is a game library providing hardware-accelerated 2D graphics based on OpenGL and SDL.

There are actively maintained ports for Windows, Linux, and OSX; and bindings for both C++ and Ruby. Besides graphics, it also provides objects and methods to help with common game-related tasks, such as obtaining user input, playing music and sound effects, and rendering text from TrueType fonts.

Gosu was written by Julian Raschke, Jan LÃ¼cker, and other contributors. Julian is the current maintainer. Gosu has been released under the MIT license.

There is an active [https://www.libgosu.org/cgi-bin/mwf/forum_show.pl forum] containing numerous threads about solving problems with Gosu, projects created with it, and updates to the library itself.
