The talk page needs more info? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 23:45, 21 September 2009 (UTC)
: Isn't that kinda meta? --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 01:23, 22 September 2009 (UTC)
:: When consistent then yes, meta. It is a difficult balance. --[[User:Dmitry-kazakov|Dmitry-kazakov]] 07:25, 22 September 2009 (UTC)
::: I really wanted to say that the main page needs more info. :-) I was in a hurry though, so I just used the template I knew of. â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 07:46, 22 September 2009 (UTC)
::::The template can go on the main page. That's what it's used for. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 12:05, 22 September 2009 (UTC)
