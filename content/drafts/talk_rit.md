Anyone have any idea how to get this to stop showing up on the [[Special:BrokenRedirects|Broken Redirects]] page? -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 16:01, 23 May 2011 (UTC)
: The body of the page content is simply "<nowiki>REDIRECT [[wp:Rochester Institute of Technology]]</nowiki>". It may require a bugfix to the MW interwiki code. Best interim solution would probably be to find anything that links to [[RIT]] and change those links to point to [[wp:Rochester Institute of Technology]]. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 16:24, 23 May 2011 (UTC)
::It was on my user page long ago. I was playing around with the interwiki links when I crated this page. I just deleted it so we don't have to worry about it anymore. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 02:54, 31 May 2011 (UTC)
