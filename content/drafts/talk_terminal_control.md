Note that terminals have a "bell" even if it's implemented as a beep. Let's use the correct terminology. –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:48, 5 October 2010 (UTC)
==Is this a task, really?==
How can this be a task if it has no goals to achieve in it? Perhaps it should be converted into a category? –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 12:14, 8 October 2010 (UTC)

== Terminals? ==

The concept of "what is a terminal" has some ambiguities.

For example, some languages, which interact only with a single class of hardware, have a much simpler job than other languages which deal with a wide variety of hardware.  

Consider, for example, 

# a language which interacts with a browser (like javascript), 
# a language which runs only on certain hardware (like some dialects of basic), 
# a language which uses some specialized graphical environment (like logo),
# a language which probably can assume unix is present (like awk),
# a language in typical use might have to deal with any of the above cases, or others... (like java)

Perhaps these tasks could do with an explicit statement that any kind of terminal control is acceptable?

By terminal, I am referring to a text terminal or an emulation of such a device, or a computer screen that can generally behave as a character terminal, even though it may also have graphical capabilities (such as a ZX Spectrum or Amstrad 901 type display system.) A graphical display system (such as a CAD workstation) that displays non proportional text, graphical widgets and icons is not considered to be a terminal under this definition.
