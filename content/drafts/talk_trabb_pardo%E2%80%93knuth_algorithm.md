==Notes==
I don't have access to the WP reference works and just went from the WP article and some of the examples on its external references. I hope the numbered parts to the requirements will ensure that the task can be completed by most. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 20:21, 22 May 2012 (UTC)
: Hmm, it's an awkward one as there isn't a copy in the academic library here (the library only has partial coverage of US-published-only works). –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:29, 23 May 2012 (UTC)

== Python code ==

I'm not entirely convinced by the Python implementations, especially given that the WP samples seem to be very focused on accepting exactly 11 numbers. While yes, the greater generality of the Python code is what I'd go for as well ''normally'', this task is much more exact than that I believe. –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:23, 23 May 2012 (UTC)

==Goto D==
OK Bearophile, I'll bite. ''Why use the <code>goto</code> instead of some kind of <code>do..until got_eleven_numbers</code> structured programming approach in the D language example?''

==ALGOL 60 and  the prompt==
The ALGOL 60 example does not do the following part of the task:
* '''Print a prompt''' before accepting eleven, textual, numeric inputs. 
If this is to make it more like the original case rather than what I could glean from wikipedia then please remove the banner and add a small explanation ; if it is not then please update the example. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 05:34, 4 June 2012 (UTC)

: Yeah, even the ALGOL example was only there to introduce the algorithm to the audiences of the mid-'70s, before delving 25 years further back in time. The systems that are the subject of the report mostly predated notions of keyboard interaction or textual I/O. --[[User:Saccade|Saccade]] 05:59, 5 June 2012 (UTC)

:: Thanks Saccade for the update to the Algol entry. (Now I wonder what the original Algol looked like though :-)

==Function made invisible by under-tested cosmetic edits at 18:57, 15 April 2016==

Under-tested cosmetic edits made to the task page at 18:57, 15 April 2016, including the injection of spaces around expressions in &lt;math&gt; tags, have left the function to be used completely invisible to all browsers which display the graphic file version of formulae rather than processing the MathML (this is, in fact, the majority of browsers). The MediaWiki processor does not currently expect such spaces, and generates syntactically ill-formed HTML if they are introduced. Other aspects of these cosmetic edits may further compound the problem. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 21:54, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
