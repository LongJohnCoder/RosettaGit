==Task description==
A “sphere cuboid”?? WTF… –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:57, 25 March 2011 (UTC)
: If I were fooled by the english meaning of that phrase, I would think that the task was to draw a regular cube.  However, the image on the PureBasic implementation shows me that at least one person believes differently.  --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 16:46, 25 March 2011 (UTC)

Sorry - That was a mispaste. It should just read "sphere".

== PureBasic image? ==

To my mere untrained Layman's eye, this does not look like a sphere. If anything, I'd say, it looks like a butt.[[User:Sgeier|Sgeier]] 16:37, 25 April 2011 (UTC)
: well, it says "animated".. so if you animate the butt, maybe it looks more like a sphere. would be nice if somebody could paste a better picture. --[[User:Oenone|Oenone]] 12:58, 10 May 2011 (UTC)

== Perspective?? ==

I'm probably just missing something subtle here, but as far as I understand projective geometry, there's no "perspective" involved in rendering a sphere - it looks round no matter how it's projected, no? As opposed to a box that can be sheared or distorted in a number of entertaining ways. Right? Wrong? I'm scratching my head here ...[[User:Sgeier|Sgeier]]

Indeed. But there must be sufficient voodoo to make it not look like a flat circle or disk.
[[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 22:11, 25 April 2011 (UTC)

Or, you could do it at the PureBasic version. E.g. animate the drawing of the sphere and thereby make it more clear to the user that is is indeed a 3D object presented on the Screen --[[User:Jofur|&lt;Jofur&gt;]] 05:28, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

You could even use a wireframe mesh!

: We all know that earth's moon is a sphere.   But because of the lighting (by our sun), it does not look round (except during a full moon), but rather, it looks/appears like a crescent most of the time.   I think that <strike>all</strike> most of the "ASCII-art" renderings are a depiction of a sphere using a light source (above and to the viewer's left). -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] 20:02, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

... And for some perspective levity on the perspective of the perspective:

Without a light source, here are six views:   a front &amp; back, top &amp; bottom, left &amp; right views of a small sphere against a light background:

&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;
