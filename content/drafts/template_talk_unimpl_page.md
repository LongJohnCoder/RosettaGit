==Issues==
Note that there is a problem with the search facilities used in this template when dealing with tasks that are categories (e.g., [[:Category:RCBF]]) as they appear here even if a solution in the language is in the category. I've no idea if MediaWiki can be taught to deal with the problem. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 09:23, 5 December 2009 (UTC)
: The only immediately workable solution I can think of is to add the category page ([[:Category:RCBF]]) to the language category, and leave [[RCBF/SomeLang]] out of the language category.  The other possibility is to change the way tasks that are categories are organized, but that requires a little more effort for transition. There are some tasks that simply put references to another wiki page underneath the <nowiki>=={{header|SomeLang}==</nowiki> block; That would work as well. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 17:06, 5 December 2009 (UTC)

==Language category==
Now that the language template has a link to these pages do you think we can remove them from the category listings? That @ stuff looks bad. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:16, 11 February 2010 (UTC)
