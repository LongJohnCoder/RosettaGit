==Explanation==
Aren't they all to some extent? I guess this category needs a paragraph of explanation. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 05:09, 2 August 2011 (UTC)

: If we had [[:Category:Domain-specific programming languages]] this would be a subcat.  It's a list of languages that are not intended for general use (though many can be used that way) but for solving math problems.  
: The list so far includes calculators (bc, GP, and the TI-BASICs), proof assistants (Coq), computer algebra systems (Maple, Mathematica, Maxima), and so forth.
: I created it to separate [[:Category:Mathematics]] which was used for both languages and tasks.
