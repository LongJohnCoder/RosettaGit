The reason for the reversing direction is purely to show that everything is still responsive to the user. It's ''not'' because it is inherently interesting to me. :-) What it does do is provide the link to the world of games, where "animations that respond to clicks" are all the rage... â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 14:42, 15 June 2009 (UTC)
: In that spirit, the LabVIEW code uses a toggle switch: the text goes in the direction that the switch is pointing. Clicking on the actual text would involve events, which aren't easy in LabVIEW. --[[User:Crazyfirex|Crazyfirex]] 22:49, 21 January 2012 (UTC)
