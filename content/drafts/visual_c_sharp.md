{{implementation|C sharp}}{{collection|Visual Studio}}

'''Microsoft Visual C#''' is [[Microsoft]]'s implementation of the [[:Category:C sharp|C#]] specification, included in the [[:Category:Visual Studio|Visual Studio]] suite of products. It is based on the [[wp:Ecma International|ECMA]]/[[wp:International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] specification of the C# language, which Microsoft also created. While multiple implementations of the specification exist, Visual C# is by far the one most commonly used. In most contexts, an unqualified reference to "C#" is taken to mean "Visual C#."

Visual C# is currently used in development of [[Windows]] and [[wp:Xbox Live|Xbox Live]] games via [[wp:Microsoft XNA|Microsoft XNA]], which allows game developers to create and share their games with other gamers.
