== Do we need a whole new task? ==

Could this be added to [[Arithmetic/Complex]]? It seems weird to have a separate task for something this simple. I know that task is older and has a lot of implementations, but if a language has a complex library built in then it probably has this function. I think it would be simple to make the change for many languages. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:28, 26 January 2012 (UTC)

: [[Arithmetic/Complex]] already shows complex conjugate for a few languages. I created this draft because I believed that complex conjugate was not part of [[Arithmetic/Complex]]. I like your idea, and I will merge [[complex conjugate]] into [[Arithmetic/Complex]] unless another user performs the merge, or gives a different idea. Also, I intend to create another task for [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConjugateTranspose.html conjugate transpose] of a matrix. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:52, 26 January 2012 (UTC)
::The conjugate transpose sounds like a different beast so it should be separate from [[Matrix transposition]]. Be sure to include a link to and from the plain transpose page too. Unless of course someone else thinks that it could be merged into the original transpose page. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:59, 26 January 2012 (UTC)
:::Conjugate Transpose is the composition of conjugate with transpose.  I am not sure that's worth a task. In the worst case you might have to map conjugate over every element of a matrix, but other than that it's either two function calls or a builtin. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 22:32, 29 January 2012 (UTC)
