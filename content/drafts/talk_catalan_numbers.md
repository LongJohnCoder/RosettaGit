==C++:An Alternative approach==
Really needs some explanation to merit citing from the task description. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 06:22, 22 April 2013 (UTC)

==relative speeds of formulas for Catalan numbers==

Some relative speeds for the four versions (three versions, the first version itself has two versions) are shown under the REXX programming example. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 07:43, 27 June 2014 (UTC)


==All formulae rendered invisible to many browsers by cosmetic edits==

Cosmetic edits made to the task page on 20 April 2016, including the injection of spaces around expressions in &lt;math&gt; tags, have left all of the formulae completely invisible to all browsers which display the graphic file version of formulae rather than processing the MathML (this is, in fact, the majority of browsers). The MediaWiki processor does not currently expect such spaces, and generates syntactically ill-formed HTML if they are introduced. Other aspects of these edits may further compound the problem.
