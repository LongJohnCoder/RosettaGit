== incorrect examples ==

I suppose incorrect examples could be marked as "epoch fail"s. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 21:38, 8 August 2011 (UTC)

== Coming out of draft ==

This task seems to be filling up without hassle, but [[User:Mwn3d/Personal policies#Upgrading tasks from "draft"|I like to wait a week]] before taking a task out of draft. If no one says anything before then, I'll bring it out of draft sometime on the 15th. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 13:57, 11 August 2011 (UTC)
