==task output==
Instead of finding (and I presume, display) all the '''Smith''' numbers below 10,000,

to reduce the amount of data display, how about just displaying all the '''Smith'''

numbers below 1,000, and then also just show the   ''count''   of '''Smith''' numbers 
below 10,000?   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 03:19, 25 April 2016 (UTC)

Then, for optional credit, show the count of '''Smith''' numbers below 100,000 and

also 1 million.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 03:19, 25 April 2016 (UTC)
 
==task output requirements==
It wasn't specifically asked for (in the task's requirements),   but it's usually a

a good thing for the programming entries to show their output   (if feasible),

and also make the Rosetta Code task's output requirements unambiguously known.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 03:19, 25 April 2016 (UTC)

However, showing all '''Smith''' numbers below 10k is pushing it, especially if all

the programming entries choose to show their output.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 03:19, 25 April 2016 (UTC)

==task wording==
In the phrase in the task's definition preamble:

<big>
:::: ''the sum of digits of its prime factors excluding 1''
</big>


isn't the text       <big> ''excluding 1'' </big>       redundant as unity will never be a prime factor   (by definition).   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 03:26, 25 April 2016 (UTC)
