Might it make sense for POSIX-ish OS's to include this category, similar to how they already include [[:Category:Operating Systems]]? Or is that not the intended purpose for this page? (It says that it's a '''library''', but AFAIK that's not entirely true. In Windows, it's a subsystem; in *nix, it's pretty much just the way it is.) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 01:08, 9 October 2009 (UTC)
