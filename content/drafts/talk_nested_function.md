Seems to me that this topic has already been covered by the [[Scope/Function_names_and_labels]] task, with allowances for languages that can't easily nest functions. I don't know that this one adds anything not in the other task. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 18:57, 17 September 2016 (UTC)

: I created this topic because the Wikipedia page was missing an example for C#, and I thought it would be nice to have a page here with the same name. The [[Scope/Function_names_and_labels]] task (which I didn't know when I created this task) seems to cover a broader topic. I intended this task for Wikipedia readers who wanted to know specific details about this single topic. --[[User:Roland Illig|Roland Illig]] ([[User talk:Roland Illig|talk]]) 21:43, 17 September 2016 (UTC)
