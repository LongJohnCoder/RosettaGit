[[Category:Encyclopedia]]'''{{TeX}}''' (the X stands for the greek &Chi; letter and so pronounced as ''ch'' in te''ch''nics, and written with a lowercase 'e' in imitation of the logo) is a [[wp:typesetting|typesetting]] language and system designed and mostly written by [[wp:Donald Knuth|Donald E. Knuth]].

See wikipedia [[wp:TeX|{{TeX}}]] for more.

Normally a ''bare'' {{TeX}} is hardly usable to typeset, so ''macro packages'' are often used. The basic macro package given as default is [[PlainTeX|{{PlainTeX}}]]; a very common and widely used macro package is [[LaTeX|{{LaTeX}}]], but there are many.
