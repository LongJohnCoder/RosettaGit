Babel is an interpreted language. It is an untyped, stack-based, postfix language with support for arrays, lists and hashes (dictionaries).
Babel 1.0 will support built-in crypto-based verification of code in order to enable safer remote code execution.

Babel is implemented in C.
It is still under development with a v0.9 release planned for December 2012,
so please excuse the dust and debris in the current implementation, available here:

Check out the README and the doc/ folder on github for more information.
