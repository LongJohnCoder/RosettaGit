How about going the other direction? Converting an octal or hexadecimal string into an integer? Can we add that to the task or start another task for it? --[[Special:Contributions/128.97.244.41|128.97.244.41]] 22:20, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
:See [[Number base conversion]]. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 05:20, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
::Yeah but you can say the same thing about what's on this page, that converting from integers to special bases are special cases of [[Number base conversion]] too. But the point is that there might be a simpler way of doing it in particular bases that there is not for general bases in your language. --[[Special:Contributions/128.97.245.57|128.97.245.57]] 07:28, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
:::I've added [[Common number base parsing]] so that that can be shown off too. I also renamed this task so it is clearer what is what. â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:14, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
