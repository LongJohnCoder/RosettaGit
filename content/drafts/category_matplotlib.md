{{library}}

'''Matplotlib''' is a plotting library for the [[Python]] programming language 
and its numerical mathematics extension [[NumPy]]. 

It can do 3D-plots, but the focus is on 2D-plotting.

Website: http://matplotlib.org/

There is a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine 

(like [[OpenGL]]), designed to closely resemble that of [[MATLAB]], 

see [http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html Plotting commands summary]
and [http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#matplotlib-pyplot-and-pylab-how-are-they-related pyplot-and-pylab].
