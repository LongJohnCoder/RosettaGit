== task clarification ==

I noticed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> task requirement was addressed (by the various programming examples) as either of:
:::* list an aggregate of the prices   (a horizontal list)
:::* list each of the prices separately   (a vertical list)

It probably doesn't make that much difference in the scheme of things, but (my) REXX example chose to perform the former (mainly because of less program clutter).

However, listing them vertically would facilitate perusing when formatting them with adjustment to the right.   This would be more in the keeping with the original intent (as I view it) of ''perform an action on each "price" element''. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 23:01, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
