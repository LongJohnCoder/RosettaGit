== Ambiguity ==

The task description currently ask that "[The cube] should be oriented so that 2 of the vertices are pointing up and down."

I can think of two ways of interpreting this specification.

One interpretation has an edge of the cube "at the top" (with the two vertices on that edge "at the top") and another edge "at the bottom".

The other interpretation has one vertex "at the top" and another vertex "at the bottom".

So I guess the issue with "2 of the vertices pointing up and down" is that a vertex that is pointing up would not be pointing down, nor vice versa. So did this mean "2 each pointing up and 2 others pointing down" or did this mean "for the set of all vertices pointing up and down, there can be only two of them".

I hope this makes sense. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 19:13, 4 May 2015 (UTC)
:It should have 1 at the top, and one at the bottom. I'll change the description. [[User:12Me21|12Me21]] ([[User talk:12Me21|talk]]) 21:03, 4 May 2015 (UTC)

::The wording "other vertex" is confusing, because there are 5 of them.
::Maybe "the cube should rotate around an axis that goes thru one vertex, the center of the cube, and the opposing vertex", and "that axis should be oriented up-down" [[User:Hajo|Hajo]] ([[User talk:Hajo|talk]]) 12:28, 5 May 2015 (UTC)
