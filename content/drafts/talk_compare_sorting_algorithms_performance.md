With AutoHotkey, the Quick Sort example returns incorrect results. Can anybody explain why?

Where did this come from?  Can we get some implementations in other languages? --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 23:43, 4 February 2008 (MST)

I've written it bottom-up unless stated otherwise for some fragments. 
This task show Python strength in ad-hoc scripting. I think Ruby's version could be feasible. I don't have an expertise to write it myself. --[[User:Goku Sama|Goku Sama]] 02:49, 5 February 2008 (MST)

== Time performance vs space performance ==

There are circumstances where performance is measured as a metric of space consumed vs time consumed.  Does anyone have any thoughts as to how we could create a task that can measure that metric? --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 04:11, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

== optional requirement ==

The [[Write float arrays to a text file]] task should be marked as an optional pre-requisite.  In some languages using a file for the intermediate results would just add complexity to the task.  --14:36, 16 February 2010 (UTC)
