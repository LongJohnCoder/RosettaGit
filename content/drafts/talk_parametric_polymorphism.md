== ALGOL 68 ==

In the "omit from" of ALGOL 68, it is stated: "it isn't immediately obvious that ALGOL 68 is object oriented". While this may be true, it is irrelevant in this context, because parametric polymorphism is completely unrelated to object-orientation. The task might nevertheless be inappropriate for ALGOL 68, but certainly not for the given reason. --[[User:Ce|Ce]] 20:22, 10 December 2009 (UTC)
: I have concerns that the editor wasn't confident enough in their analysis to make a definitive statement as to whether or not the language has support. (Though the Unimpl pages include the ommitted tasks in anticipation of that kind of error.) --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 23:25, 10 December 2009 (UTC)
: I have removed the omit of ALGOL 68 so that it may be considered by a language expert. â€”[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 16:31, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

== Non-object-oriented solutions ==

Would it be appropriate to post a solution here that shows a generic function only, for a language that doesn't support generic class types? --[[User:Mr2001|Mr2001]] 07:20, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
: The task description only specifies 'generic over another type', and isn't specific to class types, so I expect that's fine. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 13:02, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
