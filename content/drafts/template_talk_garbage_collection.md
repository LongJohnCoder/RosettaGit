This looks like an idea that never got finished. I think this kind of stuff should just go in the language template though. We can have named parameters in [[Template:Language]] that correspond with things in the [[Language Comparison Table]]. We can make categories or put new stuff in div boxes from there. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 22:08, 1 April 2009 (UTC)
