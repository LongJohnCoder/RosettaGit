When I wrote the initial part of this task, the intent was to demonstrate modularization and code separation. I would ''assume'' that to be practical and idiomatic in PicoLisp. My hunch is that part of it can be handled by breaking the command routines into a separate file for inclusion into the main bot, and that event handlers could be similarly defined. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 19:49, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
