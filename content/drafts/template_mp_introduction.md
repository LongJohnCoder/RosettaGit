Rosetta Code is a [[wp:Chrestomathy|programming chrestomathy]] site. The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.  Rosetta Code currently has {{PAGESINCAT:Programming Tasks}} [[:Category:Solutions by Programming Task|tasks]], {{PAGESINCAT:Draft Programming Tasks}} [[:Category:Draft Programming Tasks|draft tasks]], and is aware of {{PAGESINCAT:Programming Languages}} [[:Category:Programming Languages|languages]], though we do not (and cannot) have solutions to every task in every language.
