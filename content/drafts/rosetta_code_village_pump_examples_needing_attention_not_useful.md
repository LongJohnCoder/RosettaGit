{{Vptopic
|topic=The Examples Needing Attention is not useful
|summary=The main Rosetta page has a "Ways to contribute" box, linking to "Examples needing attention". That category lists languages that do not have examples needing attention.
}}

Since the Examples Needing Attention category lists numerous languages which do not currently have examples that need attention, it not useful as a "way to contribute". 

The user has no way to find examples that need attention and fix them. (Presumably that would be the "way to contribute" through such a category).

The category should only list those languages that currently have at least one example with issues.

How about a table like [[User:AndiPersti/Sandbox|this]]? It uses a Semantic Wiki query for [[Property:Example requires attention]] and puts the result into a sortable table. (Currently only [[Template:Incorrect]] sets this property). --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 21:49, 19 March 2014 (UTC)

:Ok, I finally came up with the following table: [[User:AndiPersti/Examples needing attention]]. It works for me thus I'll leave it as it is. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 18:09, 22 March 2014 (UTC)
