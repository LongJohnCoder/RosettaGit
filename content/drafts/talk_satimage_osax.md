This page doesn't explain what "Satimage.osax" actually is, isn't linked to or otherwise referenced anywhere, and the download link is incorrect. (It probably should be [http://www.satimage.fr/software/en/downloads/downloads_companion_osaxen.html this], but I don't know for sure.) I have no idea what this is, but I vote that the page gets deleted. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 19:33, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
: Looks like it was created by [[User:Macawm|Macawm]] back in 2007. I'd rather see if the guy can't be found and asked if he'd like to address it himself. Actually, he updated his user page last March, and the email-from-wiki functionality appears to be enabled. He ought to be able to be reached via that or his talk page. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 20:27, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
