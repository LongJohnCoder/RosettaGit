The wiki software is treating "OS/2" as a subpage of "OS", with the "&lt; OS" link at the top. While this is ''technically'' correct, it's not... I dunno, ''normal'' or whatever. Is there some wiki-ism to make that link go away for just this one page? -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 21:07, 7 October 2009 (UTC)
:AFAIK, the only way to not have the up-link appear is if [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Subpages its referent doesn't exist].
