==keeping score==

This Rosetta Code task (Penney's Game) states to keep score, which I interpreted as playing multiple games (or a better word would be ''innings'';   a ''game'' would therefore consist of several innings),   and keeping a running tally of the number of wins.   Am I interpreting "keeping score" correctly?   I would think just saying that the human won or lost after just one inning isn't keeping score for the game (of the total number of wins). -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 20:02, 27 September 2014 (UTC)
:I meant only checking for the players sequence in the coin flips but what you state may be a popular extension.
:I tried to pitch the task for a less experienced coder, or someone with not much time. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 04:08, 28 September 2014 (UTC)
:p.s. you only need output of two not six games.--[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 04:11, 28 September 2014 (UTC)

:: I considered the six innings as one game (so as to keep score of the number of wins).   Otherwise, a (the) score would only reflect a win or a loss, not a number of wins over six innings.   I guess it boils down to what a "game" is. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 05:33, 28 September 2014 (UTC)
