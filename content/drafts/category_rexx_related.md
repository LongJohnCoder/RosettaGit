The [[NetRexx]] programing language is another language in the Rexx family.
NetRexx produces classes for the [[Java|Java Virtual Machine]].
To quote ''The NetRexx Language'' (M. F. Cowilshaw, Pentice Hall 1997) "NetRexx classes and Java classes are entirely equivalent &mdash; NetRexx can use any Java class (and vice versa) and inherits the portability and robustness of the Java environment."
