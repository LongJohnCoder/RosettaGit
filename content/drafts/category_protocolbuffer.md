{{library}}Protocol buffer libraries are a method of serialization whereby a code generator takes a standardized definition file and generates code in a specified language that will understand and generate data generated by any code that came from the same definition file.

Please see the page for the [[D]] implementation of [http://256.makerslocal.org/wiki/index.php/ProtocolBuffer Protocol Buffers] for more details.
