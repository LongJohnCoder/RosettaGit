What <code>&lt;lang&gt;</code> tags are supported for shell scripts? --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 13:42, 9 January 2011 (UTC)
:According to [[Rosetta Code:Village Pump/Syntax Highlighting#Language tags|this list]] you should use "bash". A quick once-over of the list of available tags right below it doesn't give me any better ideas. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:36, 9 January 2011 (UTC)
::ok, thank you.  It looks like Korn Shell would be an alternative, but that we do not have a generic unix shell option.  I do not know if that matters.  I will use bash, for now, when I need to show a shell command line.  --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 02:31, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
