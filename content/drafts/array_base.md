[[Category:Encyclopedia]]
In the context of arrays indexed by integer numbers, the ''base'' is the index of the first element of the [[array]]. There exist languages that use 0 as base (like [[C]]); others use 1, others allow to specify it (and allow for negative indexes), possibly taking 0 or 1 as default values.
