This is an implementation of [[:Category:Tcl|Tcl]].

You may find other implementations of this language at [[:Category:Tcl Implementations]].</div>This library, written in [[C]], is the primary implementation of [[Tcl]]; most other implementations use this one and wrap it with additional libraries and code to form a complete executable.

Note that this is wholly distinct from [[tcllib]].
