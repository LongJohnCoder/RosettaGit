define 'video' and 'inverse'

: “Inverse video” (also called “reverse video”) is a reasonably-well understood piece of terminology for classic (text-mode) terminals such as a VT-100, and it is also supported by modern terminal emulators like xterm (and its derivatives), putty.exe and Terminal.app. Basically, for each square in use it swaps what is foreground and what is background. It isn't used in modern GUIs (they have a different model). –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 22:08, 10 November 2010 (UTC)
