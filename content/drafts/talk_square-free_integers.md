== 1000000145 isn't square-free ==

Am I missing something here?

1000000145 = 5 * 59 * 911 * 61^2

That looks very unsquare-free to me. Why is it that all of the solutions seem to have it included in the list of square-free numbers? The racket solution has unit tests to labour the point that this is wrong. --[[User:Tim-brown|Tim-brown]] ([[User talk:Tim-brown|talk]]) 18:46, 6 January 2019 (UTC)

:Hi Tim, 

::The number to be tested is one '''trillion''' one hundred forty five i.e. 1,000,000,000,145. Your number is one '''billion''' one hundred forty five i.e. 1,000,000,145.--[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 20:30, 6 January 2019 (UTC)

::: Thanks purefox. However, I cut and pasted this number from other implemtations' output. I'll fix my 1e9 -> 1e12... But I think others will need to check their respective values of a trillion. --[[User:Tim-brown|Tim-brown]] ([[User talk:Tim-brown|talk]]) 22:24, 6 January 2019 (UTC)
