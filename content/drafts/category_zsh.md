{{dead category}}
Examples for the [[Z Shell]] (zsh) now belong in [[:Category:UNIX Shell]]. Though ''zsh'' also has peculiar features, some ''zsh'' scripts are similar to, or identical to, scripts for [[Bourne Shell]] or [[Korn Shell]].

Merge the examples from Category:Zsh into [[:Category:UNIX Shell]].
