Esoteric languages are "programming" languages that are not designed for practical or convenient use. 

Instead, these are designed to be themed into something not related to programming (e.g. [[eso:Chef | Chef]]), to have the fewest instructions as possible (also called ''minimalism''), to be the most difficult to use (e.g. [[eso:Malbolge|Malbolge]]), to discover new concepts (e.g. [[Fractran|Fractran]]), or just a joke(e.g. [[HQ9%2B|HQ9+]]).


For more examples, see the [[eso:Main Page|Esoteric Programming Language Wiki]].
