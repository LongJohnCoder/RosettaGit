{{Vptopic
|topic=New reports
|summary=Report: tasks not implemented in a category
}}

Is it possible to define a new report here ?

E.g. I made a Category:Simple (with "really simple tasks"), 
and the report should list all languages that have not covered them.

Also, for a single language, much like "Reports:Tasks_not_implemented_in_AWK",
a report "Reports:Simple_Tasks_not_implemented_in_AWK",
listing the tasks listed in Category:Simple 
that have not been done yet in AWK.
