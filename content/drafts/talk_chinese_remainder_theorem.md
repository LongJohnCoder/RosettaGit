==Formulae in task and algorithm sections rendered invisible to many browsers by cosmetic edits==

Cosmetic edits made to the task page at 18:51, 29 June 2016, including the injection of spaces around expressions in &lt;math&gt; tags, have left the many formulae completely invisible to all browsers which display the graphic file version of formulae rather than processing the MathML (this is, in fact, the majority of browsers). The MediaWiki processor does not currently expect such spaces, and generates syntactically ill-formed HTML if they are introduced. Other aspects of these cosmetic edits may further compound the problem. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 08:48, 21 September 2016 (UTC)
