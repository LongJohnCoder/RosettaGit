'''Windows Script Host''' (abbreviated '''WSH'''; originally '''Windows Scripting Host''') is the scripting engine included with modern releases of [[Windows]]. WSH was first included with [[wp:Windows 98|Windows 98]], but earlier versions of Windows could also get it by installing [[wp:Internet Explorer 5|Internet Explorer 5]]. <!-- not sure about Win16 --> WSH includes runtime engines for both [[JScript]] and [[VBScript]].
