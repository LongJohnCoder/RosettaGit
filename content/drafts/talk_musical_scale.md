== Category:Hardware? ==

Should this task be categorized as being about hardware, or should that be omitted since hardware support is optional? --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 04:36, 7 November 2014 (UTC)

: This isn't that much different then the Rosetta Code task that uses (or causes) the keyboard to be used.   Granted, almost all (PC type) computers have a keyboard, but the existence of a keyboard isn't guaranteed, nor, for that matter, is an output device (console or terminal).   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:07, 7 May 2016 (UTC)
