(Newbie) When I try to edit a page to add code for one more language, I get an error message that my edit would include new external links, and I should fill google's captcha.
I prefer to get the external links out, I do not intend to put any there, and I do not have any external links, but I get this message even when I do not insert any text at all. Apparently more text is added than I see in my edit window. Where can I find these links ?
Cheers
