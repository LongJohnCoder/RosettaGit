'''Intel C++ Compiler''' (also known as '''icc''' or '''icl''') describes a group of [[:Category:C|C]]/[[:Category:C++|C++]] compilers from [[Intel]]. Compilers are available for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft]] [[Windows]], and [[Mac OS X]].

Intel C++ Compiler belongs to the family of compilers with the Edison Design Group frontend (like the SGI MIPSpro, Comeau C++, Portland Group, and others). The compiler is also notable for being widely used for SPEC CPU Benchmarks of IA-32, x86-64, and Itanium 2 architectures.

The Intel C++ Compiler is available in four forms. It is part of Intel Parallel Studio, the Intel C++ Compiler Professional Edition package, the Intel Compiler Suite package and the Intel Cluster Toolkit, Compiler Edition.
