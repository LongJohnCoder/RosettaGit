'''Commodore International''', also known as '''Commodore Business Machines (CBM)''', was a computer company that manufactured some of the best-selling computers of the early-to-mid-80's, including the [[wp:Commodore 64|Commodore 64]], perhaps the most well-known (and certainly best-selling) computer of the 80's, and the [[wp:Amiga|Amiga]], a popular workstation computer. (See also [[AmigaOS]].)

For a complete history of Commodore, see [[wp:Commodore International|Wikipedia's Commodore page]].

Recently (since 2010), a new company, '''[http://www.commodoreusa.net/ Commodore USA]''', licensed the Commodore and Amiga brand names to sell modern PCs with the form of the classic Commodore 64 (i.e. an all-in-one computer, with the "keyboard" also containing the processor, hard drive, various communication ports, etc.), along with another all-in-one using the [[wp:Commodore VIC-20|VIC]] brand name (but not the form) and 2 "Amiga" systems.
