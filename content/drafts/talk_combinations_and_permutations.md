### First two bulleted formulae invisible on standard OS X browsers

May need tidying up to achieve formula visibility on the OS X platform. Problems may include flanking of LateX expressions with redundant white space inside &lt;math&gt; tags [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 16:18, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
:: PS I notice that in Preview mode we can restore OS X Chrome and Safari visibility of the formulae by reverting the two math tag contents to their pre Aug 27 state [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 16:18, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
