I modified this template to point to the language category page, rather than the page with the same name as the language.  This should help with cases where a language implementation has the same name as the language itself.  I don't ''think'' this will break anything, but someone should mention here if it does. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 16:53, 25 November 2007 (MST)
