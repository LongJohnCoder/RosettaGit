==More info?==
How about changing the task to print a stack trace from within g() which is called from f() - and actually show sample output for inter-language ccomparison? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 18:13, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
: I don't particularly want to constrain what people call the functions as precise comparisons aren't the point of the task (the point: show facilities for debugging without having to use an external debugger) but showing what the output is is a very good idea. —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 07:52, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

== About Smalltalk ==

What's wrong with Smalltalk? It mimics the behaviour of the others (for what it is possible). --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 20:46, 14 June 2009 (UTC)
: I.e.: what was added that triggered the template "may be incorrect"? According to me it meets all the requirement... --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 20:48, 14 June 2009 (UTC)
:: There was an update to the requirements of the task (i.e., to require an actual sample stack trace so that readers can know what it looks like without running the code). I went through and tagged every answer without the output; the only one left to fix now is Smalltalk, but I can't do that for anyone as I don't have it on this system... —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:02, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

== Show the output! ==

A reminder to all who participate in this task... showing the output (or a transcription of it, depending on what's convenient to actually do) is '''required'''. The purpose is precisely to allow people to compare what traces can look like so that they can understand them when they see them.

==D entry==

Is the D entry good enough according to the Task requirements? —[[User:Bearophile|bearophile]]

:"''The task should allow the program to continue after generating the stack trace''"?
