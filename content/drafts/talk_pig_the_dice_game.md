<i>The goal of this task is to create a program to score for and <u>simulate</u> dice throws for a two-person game.</i>

I read this as meaning the game was completely simulated without human participation, but the examples seem
to do otherwise. Am I off base doing a simulation rather than a real game? [[User:La Longue Carabine|La Longue Carabine]] 04:08, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

:I was confused about this too, but then noticed the draft task: Pig the dice game/Player, which also simulates the player.  --[[User:Loren|Loren]] 05:46, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

:Sorry guys. I meant simulate the throwing of dice in that sentence. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 08:02, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

:: I just took the hard road and supported both (or neither) humans and computer players (for the REXX example), with any number of each (instead of just two).   Also supported an option for the number for the win, personalized the players' names, and allowed for an '''N''' sided die.   A fair amount of code was used to make to output very readable (as far as whitespace, indentations, and separators. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 00:13, 26 February 2014 (UTC)

==Move Go?==
Would the Go example be better placed at [[Pig the dice game/Player]]? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 08:06, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

That seems reasonable. <strike>I don't have time right now, but will move it sometime today.</strike> OK, I shirked my duty for a few moments and moved it. But the task doesn't seem to build a table of contents, and I'm too much of a noob to figure out how to do it. [[User:La Longue Carabine|La Longue Carabine]] 15:23, 9 November 2012 (UTC)
:Thanks :-)

: I believe a   TOC   (table of contents)   is automatically built when there are at least four entries (or section headers).   There is also a way to force a   TOC   by using the   <big><big> <nowiki> __TOC__ </nowiki> </big></big>   HTML tag (or whatever it's called).   The before and after characters are two underscores/underbars   (<big><big>'''<b>_</b>'''</big></big>).   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 05:25, 26 August 2016 (UTC)
