I want to make a new category here, but I'm not sure what to call it. I don't want to use the wrong term by accident. I want it to be something like "Language Specification" and it would include:
*[[BNF Grammar]]
*[[Scope modifiers]]
*[[Quotes]]
*[[Special characters]]
*[[Comments]]
*[[Infinity]]
*[[Null]]
and maybe more. It would be for tasks that aren't really tasks, but show something about languages (like keywords and other things from the language's definition). What do you guys think? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:19, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

:Grammar and semantics? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 19:20, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

:My opinions: BNF Grammar is not a task. It is closer to encyclopedic content. Scope modifiers are basic, like functions and flow control. Infinity is more of a numeric task, like showing off sine-cosine. Not sure how to categorize Null, but the rest are about Language Syntax. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 14:44, 26 June 2009 (UTC)
::I know BNF isn't really a task, but neither is scope modifiers, quotes, or special characters (and "It would be for tasks that aren't really tasks"). That discussion is for their talk pages, though. Scope modifiers is definitely syntax. Look at Ada, Java, and Perl there. Maybe "syntax" is the way to go, though. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:01, 26 June 2009 (UTC)
