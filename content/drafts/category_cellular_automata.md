Tasks in this category show cell-based "machines" which have an initial set up and rules for each cell's transition between "steps". The cell fields can have any number of dimensions. There is a set of possible states for each cell and the rules for the cell transitions are usually based on the [[wp:Moore neighborhood|Moore neighborhood]] of each cell.
