Got ideas about how Rosetta Code could improve?  Here's the place to post and discuss.

==Ideas==


### Interactive Languages

It should be possible to interact with languages online.  A user should be able to visit a language page and experiment with code.

===Application-level comparison===

I'd like to run an application-level comparison.  Teams representing different languages would meet, a simple application idea (I.e. a four-function calculator, a text editor or a private journal) would be chosen, and the features agreed upon.  All the (working) source would ultimately be hosted on Rosetta Code.
