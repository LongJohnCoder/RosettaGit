{{Vptopic
|topic=Author name in task solutions
|summary=What's the policy about adding one's name to a program?}}
I can understand that people are proud of their achievement, but I wonder if RC is the good place for this. As in any wiki, everybody is free to make modifications to any solution (and any task, of course). Therefore, the author name does not mean much. The history is here anyway to give the exact contribution of everyone.

Occasionally, I see an author name in a solution, and I don't think it hurts much, even if I don't think it's a good idea.

I have seen recently a user systematically adding his name and email ([[User talk:CalmoSoft]]), and I have doubts. Even on the intent actually, since we get also what seems to be a company name along with the author name: CalmoSoft. Could it be a form of advertisement? If so, it's my understanding that this behaviour is not to be encouraged.

Anyway, I would like to know if there is a clear policy about this on RC. That could be "names are ok", or "please don't insert names or other identification information".

Another problem is this author is repeatedly adding Lisp answers to tasks that already have a Common Lisp answer (and his Lisp is clearly Common Lisp). Of course, having multiple answer in the same language is perfectly acceptable, if they show a different approach. Here they do not.
