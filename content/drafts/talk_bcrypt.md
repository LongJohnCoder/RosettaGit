What's this page for? It's not marked as a task, and nothing links to it.
:I guess it could be a task. There is a [[wp:Bcrypt|WP article]] with some pseudocode. It doesn't look very descriptive though. Someone who is more familiar with the algorithm (or at least general encryption) might be able to make this into a task. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 16:36, 9 November 2011 (UTC)
