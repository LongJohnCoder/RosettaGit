{{Vptopic
|topic=Screwed pages
|summary="Reddit" button broke a number of pages.
}}
I've noticed that some pages are messed up (maybe by a change in the task template?), some others aren't; e.g. I see badly [[Creating an Associative Array]], [[Find unimplemented tasks]], [[Amb]]... and maybe more. What it seems to happen: the content of the page is "shrinked" into the right-side box, just under the Programming Task box (indeed, it seems like it is inside the Programming Task box).

It does not happen e.g. for [[Quine]], which in fact uses the Puzzle template. I am using Opera to browse the page; anyway, I believe that if Opera shows them that way, it means there's something odd. --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 14:06, 7 February 2009 (UTC)

: Fixed: [[User:Kevin Reid]] fixed it... --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 14:44, 7 February 2009 (UTC)
: Yeah, I screwed it up wth the addition of the Reddit buttons.  I could have sworn I checked to make sure everything worked before I went to sleep, though.  I did discover the problem, and thought I'd fixed it. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 19:09, 7 February 2009 (UTC)
:: I could have fixed by myself too, I suppose, if only I would have known templates too can be edited :D --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 15:16, 12 February 2009 (UTC)
