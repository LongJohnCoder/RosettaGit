Could someone expand on turtle graphics (either here or on its own page)? It seems to be something that a lot of people have heard of except for me :p. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:23, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
: Imagine Win32's MoveTo and DrawTo routines, but with a picture of a turtle wherever your current position happened to be, and instead of feeding x-y coords, you called a routine to set (or adjust; I don't recall exactly) your angle, and then a routine to move forward a certain distance.  Changing your angle changed the orientation of the turtle picture on the screen.  All in all, a cute instructive tool for vector graphics. (Particularly so if your next angle was less than 45 degrees off from a backtrack of your previous.) --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 20:57, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
