C'Dent is a Acmeist programming language for writing portable modules. It defines a common denominator AST model, that can produce equivalent Object Oriented modules in many programming languages, like: [[Perl]], [[Python]], [[PHP]], [[Ruby]], [[JavaScript]], [[Scala]], [[Java]], [[C]], [[C++]], [[ActionScript]], [[Perl 6]], [[Python 3000]], [[Go]], [[PIR]], and [[NQP]]. Its input syntax is a strict subset of a subset of the output languages. Currently: [[Python]], [[JavaScript]] and Perl 6.

The main idea behind the language, is that if you write modules in a strict subset of your favorite programming language, the modules can be shipped to many languages' module repositories. [[TestML]] and [[Stardoc]] are related Acmeist projects for portable unit tests and documentation, respectively.
