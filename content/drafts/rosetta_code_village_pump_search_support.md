I would really like to be able to search the wiki through the search box. Currently it says that Rosetta Code search is disabled. Why? Google seems to be missing a large fraction of the pages on the wiki, and there is no other way to find stuff on Rosetta Code. Other wiki projects have a functional search, why can't we? (Sorry if this has been asked before; but due to the lack of search I have trouble finding anything about it.) Thanks, --[[Special:Contributions/76.173.203.58|76.173.203.58]] 04:59, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
:If it is a matter of cost, then I'm all for keeping costs down. I do realize that at the moment, the originator pays the full cost of the site himself. 
Thank you, thank you, '''Thank you'''! --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 06:41, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
::The default search that came with the Wiki was pretty bad. So we added this external search (try to search for something in the regular search and a box will come up so that you can use it), but that had its own set of problems (not live, logs you out). I think efforts were stopped out of frustration (and probably lack of time). --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 12:04, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
:::On the [http://wiki.tcl.tk/ Tcler's Wiki] we use a search that is google-powered. We've found it gives pretty good results (except for the time-lag between updates and the indices getting rebuilt.) â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 13:03, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
::How was the the defauld search bad? At least in Wikipedia, the search works just fine. --[[User:PauliKL|PauliKL]] 14:44, 30 June 2009 (UTC)
