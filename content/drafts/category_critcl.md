{{stub}}
{{library}}
This library for [[Tcl]] is used to allow inline [[C]] code directly inside scripts as a foreign language. The library manages access to the compiler and caching the compiled code so that repeat runs are fast. The code that it builds is loaded into the Tcl interpreter as a dynamic library.
