==Delete this template==

{{BoxImage|Plotxy-TI-89.png|BoxImage example}}

[[File:Plotxy-TI-89.png|frame|right|File link example]]

I propose to delete this template as it doesn't do anything MediaWiki's own image markup doesn't. Example to the right. â€”[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 14:30, 15 August 2009 (UTC)
