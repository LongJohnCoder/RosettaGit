The description of the pinstripes seems to be a little bit ambiguous.  Should they be drawn vertically (i.e. |||) or horizontally (i.e. ===) across the width of the display? --[[User:Demivec|Demivec]] 09:25, 4 June 2011 (UTC)

: These are vertical pinstripes that run from top down, and there is a sufficient number of stripes to span the entire width of the display. --[[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 10:15, 4 June 2011 (UTC)

== Output? ==

I notice there isn't any output given for any implementation... should it be required?
:They would all look pretty much the same, but a reference image at the top of the page might be nice. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 17:12, 28 November 2011 (UTC)
:: I added one. --[[User:Dgamey|Dgamey]] 21:35, 10 December 2011 (UTC)

== See Also? ==

IMO it should link to Colour Pinstripe/Display after the task description. --[[User:Crazyfirex|Crazyfirex]] 21:06, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
: and that too --[[User:Dgamey|Dgamey]] 21:39, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
