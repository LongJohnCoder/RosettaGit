{{Vptopic

|summary=Script to find problems unsolved in X language
}}

I wanted to contribute something easy in Python, but it seemed like everything had already been done in Python. So I wrote a script in Python to find out if there were any Python problems left. There were. Then, I improved the code and made it general, so you type in whatever programming language you're interested in. It returns in an instant for this site's popular languages like Tcl and Python, so it should work for whatever language you want to develop in.
