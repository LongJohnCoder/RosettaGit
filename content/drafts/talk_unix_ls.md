==Clarification needed==
Not everyone runs Unix. You might want to give an example of the format required. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 12:03, 5 June 2014 (UTC)

:- Thanks :-)

==On Task Status==
What conditions must the task meet before it can be promoted? [[User:Wei2912|Wei2912]] ([[User talk:Wei2912|talk]]) 12:29, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

:It's a judgement call usually made after four independant languages, (and four authors), and no ongoing issues on the talk page. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 18:58, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

::Thanks. In that case, looks like this task is ready to be promoted? It has six authors, 6 independant languages and no ongoing issues. [[User:Wei2912|Wei2912]] ([[User talk:Wei2912|talk]]) 17:56, 8 June 2014 (UTC)
