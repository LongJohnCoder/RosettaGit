==Rename==
Anyone have a problem with renaming this as [[:Category:Câ™¯]]?--[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 22:15, 12 October 2008 (UTC)
:I dunno. Is it better to type <nowiki>"[[C sharp|C#]]" or use the entity reference &#x266f?</nowiki> --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:57, 2 December 2008 (UTC)
: Note: Wikipedia has chosen the capitalized spellings [[wp:C Sharp (programming language)]] and [[wp:F Sharp (programming language)]] --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 17:17, 18 February 2010 (UTC)
