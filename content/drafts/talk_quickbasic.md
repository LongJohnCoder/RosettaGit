==Move to category?==

I'm thinking about changing this page to a category. This would allow marking modern QB-compatible compilers as QB implementations. It would also allow <nowiki>{{header|QuickBASIC}}</nowiki>, as already seen with [[:Category:PureBasic|PureBasic]], [[:Category:PowerBASIC|PowerBASIC]], etc.

Is there any reason to ''not'' do this? Or alternately, any reason for me to do this ''right now don't wait''? -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 02:01, 24 November 2011 (UTC)
