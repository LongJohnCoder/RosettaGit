==Duplicate of Execute a system command==
We already have a task [[Execute_a_system_command]]. This is just using a different (destructive) command. There isn't anything gained by this task. It will depend entirely on interacting with the operating system of the device, not the language used. (Unless the language IS the operating system, in which case it is still just interacting with the operating system.)

RosettaCode is not a reference manual showing every possible command that can be executed. I vote for deletion. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 14:02, 4 July 2019 (UTC)

:Seconded, there are umpteen system commands for doing this on Linux alone so the task seems pointless from a language point of view. --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 17:58, 8 July 2019 (UTC)

:Delete â€“ the Rosetta stone is not a word list [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 08:54, 9 July 2019 (UTC)
