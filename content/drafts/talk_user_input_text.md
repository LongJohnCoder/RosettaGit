== How does string input in befunge work??? ==

I can't find any information...

:In Befunge, user input only works with single characters, not with strings.

== Unclear Task ==

I don't think I understand what the task is saying, and based on the code examples, neither do a lot of other people. The answers don't consistently demonstrate what to do.

Does the string matter? Do I even need to store it? After that, do I loop until I get 75000, then exit?

:I agree. The task is not specified well enough, and the inconsistent examples reflect that problem.
