Some time ago, someone went through and applied pylint to all of the Python examples on Rosetta Code. This resulted in the Python code being far more readable than it had previously been. Obviously, Python is not the only language we cover. If you have the appropriate tools available, and you're willing to go through and apply a lint tool to the examples of a particular language, please note it below. (I ''highly'' recommend personally monitoring any automation you set up. Furthermore, I also request that you note whatever settings given to the lint tool took, so that others can repeat the process, possibly with other settings in the future.) --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 17:16, 7 November 2010 (UTC)
