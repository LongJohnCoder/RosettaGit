Is this supposed to be a language? What's the purpose for this category? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:49, 15 February 2010 (UTC)
: If there is no pure implementation or base common syntax, and all other languages are derivatives, it's probably just fine to have those other languages as subcategories, and treat this like one of the categories you might find in the LCT.  I don't completely follow whether this page is intended to be considered a language itself. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 20:59, 15 February 2010 (UTC)
It's here because I'm getting around to posting some solutions in Clipper/Harbour which are both xBase dialects. --[[User:Axtens|Axtens]] 03:14, 16 February 2010 (UTC) ... and I haven't been reading the friendly manual about how to create language pages (blush) --[[User:Axtens|Axtens]] 03:24, 16 February 2010 (UTC)
: Don't worry about the occasional mistake or misstep; folks around here are pretty good at getting things cleaned up. I don't care to count how many times someone's fixed my typos. I think you'll be just fine... --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 06:04, 16 February 2010 (UTC)
