{{library}}'''POSIX''' or "Portable Operating System Interface" is a standard for systems that resemble [[Unix]]. The current version, [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/toc.htm POSIX.1-2008], is a project of both the [[IEEE]] and the Open Group. More information is at [[wp:POSIX|POSIX at Wikipedia]].

* POSIX defines an [[API]] for [[C]] programs, with functions such as <tt>fork()</tt>, <tt>opendir()</tt>, <tt>regcomp()</tt>, <tt>wait()</tt> and <tt>unlink()</tt>.
* POSIX also defines commands such as <tt>[[AWK|awk]]</tt>, <tt>[[bc]]</tt>, <tt>grep</tt>, <tt>ls</tt>, <tt>[[m4]]</tt>, <tt>rm</tt>, <tt>[[sed]]</tt> and <tt>[[UNIX Shell|sh]]</tt>.

The pages in this category have examples marked <nowiki>{{libheader|POSIX}}</nowiki>. These examples require some of the POSIX functions; a [[C]] or [[C++]] example that calls <tt>fork()</tt> would be in this category. Some languages, like [[Ada]] or [[Perl]], have a POSIX library.

POSIX threads go in [[:Category:pthread]].
