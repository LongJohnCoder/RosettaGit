This page should redirect to Category:GTK (or viceversa?), and using libheader|GTK+ should be the same as using libheader|GTK (i.e. the examples with those categories should be seen altogether); Wikipedia redirect GTK to GTK+, but I would go for the opposite... --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 12:06, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
: As far as I'm aware almost everyone calls it “GTK”, so that's the name that we should use. —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 12:51, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
:If you set up a redirect from here though whenever anyone uses GTK+ in a libheader it won't show up in GTK. I wish there were a way to fix that. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 14:21, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
:: Hm... so I suppose a fast fix means changing GTK+ to GTK and avoiding libheader|GTK+... It won't be hard since there are few examples using GTK+... going to do so. --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 15:08, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
