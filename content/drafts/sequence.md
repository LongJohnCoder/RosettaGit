A sequence is an ordered list of values. A sequence might be an [[array]] or [[linked list]] that contains the values, or it might be a lazy sequence that knows how to generate the values.

Some languages, like [[Common Lisp]] and [[Factor]], use the term ''sequence''; but some other languages, like [[Java]], prefer the term ''list'' for the same idea.
