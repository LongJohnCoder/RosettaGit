Once again I'm not sure what to call something. What would be a good name for the feature that includes:
*Compiled (machine code)
*Compiled (bytecode)
*Interpreted
Execution? I don't know. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 14:19, 14 July 2009 (UTC)
:Somewhere in Wikipedia (Portuguese) it's called "Execution Method". I think it's OK.
