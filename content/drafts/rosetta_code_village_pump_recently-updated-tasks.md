Hi I have joined yesterday and just updated 3 tasks

1.Added additional C sharp solution to one that already existed (see that  [https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Talk:Zebra_puzzle page's talk])
[https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Zebra_puzzle#.22Manual.22_solution_.28Norvig-style.29 Zebra Puzzle C sharp Norvig style]

2.Created new c sharp solution. Found from [https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Reports:Tasks_not_implemented_in_C_sharp Not implemented in C Sharp] - now I have provided it, this no longer shows up in that link
[https://rosettacode.org/wiki/World_Cup_group_stage#C.23 World Cup Group Stage C sharp]

3.And this one, just to see if the the link under question works - it did for this change!
[https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#Shorter LCG C Sharp shorter]

So why is (3) showing up (the last one submitted), but not the earlier (1) or (2) submissions?
