Why is the information from [[Libraries]] also here? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 11:17, 30 January 2008 (MST)
::With the way things stand, [[Libraries]] could simply be redirected here.  However, I'd rather see Libraries expanded to include more than cursory information. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 20:06, 30 January 2008 (MST)
Should this be on the sidebar now that it has a bit more information? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 07:16, 8 February 2008 (MST)
:::Not yet.  It just doesn't feel right to grow the sidebar that quickly. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 12:36, 9 February 2008 (MST)
:: How do I add a library page?? --[[User:Dgamey|Dgamey]] 02:41, 14 April 2010 (UTC)
