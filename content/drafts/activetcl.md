{{implementation|Tcl}}ActiveTcl (http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/) is a distribution of [[Tcl]] by ActiveState for many common platforms (and is considered to be the standard one on [[Windows]]).
Includes both [[tclsh]] and [[wish]], as well as many extension packages (notably [[tcllib]], [[Critcl]], [[:Category:SQLite|SQLite]], [[:Category:Snack|Snack]], [[:Category:TDOM|tDOM]], [[:Category:TkImg|Img]], which are used to solve some of the tasks on Rosetta Code).
