<!-- [[User:Kevin Reid]]: I recommend keeping this info reasonably short, as we don't need to duplicate Wikipedia's effort. There should be just enough information to help a Rosetta Code reader navigate. -->
[[Foreign function interface]], or FFI, is a common name for a facility in a programming language (especially a high-level one that does not usually work in terms of pointers, raw structure layout, etc.) to invoke functions and access data structures defined using another one (especially [[C]]).

The term is commonly used in [[Common Lisp]] and [[Haskell]]. <!-- Expand this list? Don't mention at all? -->

==Relevant tasks==

<!-- [[User:Kevin Reid]]: I don't think these tasks should be put under FFI as a main category, because they are all relevant to languages such as C itself where these operations are not "foreign". -->
