This page and [[:Category:6502 Assembler|6502 Assembler]] should be merged. -- 09:00, 20 May 2010 [[User:EdK|EdK]]
: [[User:UnderBot|UnderBot]] has the ability to do this, but the examples will need to have their usage of [[Template:header]] manually adjusted to use the correct language naming. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 13:14, 20 May 2010 (UTC)
: Done. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 15:01, 24 May 2010 (UTC)
::The 6502 Assembler page no longer exists. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 14:08, 9 September 2010 (UTC)

== Language vs virtual machine ==

This language, along with some like x86 assembly, are particular to a virtual machine as defined by a processor spec. I'm thinking they should be considered as such, and different assemblers take the role of 'language' as RC normally thinks of it. Does that make sense to anyone else? --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 13:19, 9 September 2010 (UTC)

== Emulator ==

Here is a 6502 emulator which runs in the browser:  http://e-tradition.net/bytes/6502/

Of course, you need to program the emulator in machine language rather than assembly language, but as the 6502 has far fewer instructions than most other 8 bit microprocessors (the original 6502 only had 151 opcodes) it is not that difficult to memorize the machine instructions you need most frequently.
