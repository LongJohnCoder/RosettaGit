== Draft reason ==

I feel like this is an easy target for the people who want tasks to be "well-defined". If it needs more definition, have at it. If it doesn't, then undo the drafting. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 01:43, 30 December 2010 (UTC)
: Is printing the data out the best thing to do with it? (I suppose it is…) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 14:30, 30 December 2010 (UTC)

== Store in a variable or memory space ==

Is there any reason for specifying an integer array for storage here? Shouldn't we just say store in a variable or memory space? The sound could be encoded into a string, or other data type, or even just stored raw in a memory area.

== Signed or unsigned sound? Rate? ==

Can we clarify whether the sound should be in signed 16-bit or unsigned 16-bit format? And whether the rate is 8000 Hz, 44100 Hz, or some other value? These are the two attributes of raw sound that the task forgot to specify. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:43, 2 August 2011 (UTC)
