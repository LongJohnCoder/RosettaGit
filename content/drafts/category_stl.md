{{library}}The '''Standard Template Library''' or '''STL''' is collection of [[C++]] libraries written as portable templates which implement a variety of containers, iterators, and algorithms. It was originally written by SGI, and nowadays forms a subset of the [[C++ Standard Library]]. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library Wikipedia] for more details.
