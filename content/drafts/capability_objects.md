{{stub}}{{capability}}Objects are data structures with associated functions, where data access can be restricted to the corresponding functions. Unlike modules, there can be many objects of the same type, and they can be created and destroyed at run time. Objects are also the base of object oriented programming (OOP), however OOP includes also other capabilities like [[Capability:Run time polymorphism|Run time polymorphism]].
