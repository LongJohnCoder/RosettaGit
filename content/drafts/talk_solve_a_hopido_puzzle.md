Quoting from this Rosetta Code task preamble: 

:''Knowing the kindness in the heart of every contributor to Rosetta Code, I know that we shall feel that as an act of humanity   '''we must solve these puzzles for them in let's say milliseconds'''.''

Gleaning from this, should the computer program entries display the (elapsed) time used to solve the problem (let's say), rounded up to <sup>'''1'''</sup>/<sub>'''10'''</sub> of a second?   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 04:04, 11 April 2016 (UTC)

: Maybe. Personally, though - since no upper bound was specified - I'd be inclined to accept anything up to at least a million milliseconds. Or, if that quip was intended to be a constraint on programmer time, I'd personally think we should allow much, much higher than that. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 00:28, 12 April 2016 (UTC)

:: Well, from my ole mainframe days, when somebody used the word   ''milliseconds'',   it was always assumed to mean   ''sub-second''.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 01:38, 12 April 2016 (UTC)

::: I was being a bit tongue-in-cheek. That said, the guidelines for [[Rosetta_Code:Add_a_Task|adding a task]] do suggest that we should try to favor what people can supply over overly strict requirements. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 14:10, 12 April 2016 (UTC)
