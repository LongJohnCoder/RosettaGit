{{language|XQuery
|site=http://www.w3.org/XML/Query
|LCT=no
}}{{language programming paradigm|functional}}'''XQuery''', is a declarative query and transformation language for [[XML]] data specified by W3C. XQuery has similarities to [[XSLT]] like '''XPath''' for path expressions. In fact, XQuery 1.0 is a superset of XPath 2.0.

Unlike XSLT the XQuery syntax looks similar to [[SQL]] and consists of '''FLOWR''' expressions. FLOWR stands for '''for''', '''let''', '''order by''', '''where''' and '''return'''.
