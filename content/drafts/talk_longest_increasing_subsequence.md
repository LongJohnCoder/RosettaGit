==Naming the methods==

In order to avoid long subsection titles, I suggest:

* not mentioning the programming language again
* using ''dynamic programming'' and ''patience sorting'' as names

:Hi Grondilu, I would want to mention at least an abbreviation of the language name in my subheadings directly below my header line as that way if someone makes an edit later, the Summary points directly at the language+sub-heading, making it easier to locate an edit on a large page. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 05:19, 18 August 2013 (UTC)

== Splitting in two subtasks? ==

What about splitting this in:

* [[Longest increasing subsequence/Dynamic programming]]
* [[Longest increasing subsequence/Patience sorting]]

?

: Are you going to take the effort to work out what all the existing solutions are supposed to be categorised as? Or take the effort to locate descriptions of the algorithms of sufficient quality to allow implementation generally? (I say that because the description on Wikipedia of the LIS algorithm is poor.) â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 10:54, 19 August 2013 (UTC)

: Note also that neither of those algorithms is necessary for the task as it is currently defined. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 22:56, 7 September 2013 (UTC)

::Yep, it's algorithm agnostic so far. I originally only knew of the one way of doing things and am grateful for the others.--[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 16:04, 8 September 2013 (UTC)
