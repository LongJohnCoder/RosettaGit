== VB ==

Shouldn't the VB example have code? Is it the same as the .NET code? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 16:17, 11 May 2009 (UTC)

== Racket ==

I renamed Scheme example back to Racket since the code is not standard R5RS or R6RS code (it uses the "#lang racket" pragma) and Racket is not Scheme (but Scheme is a part of Racket when #lang is set to r5rs or r6rs). &mdash; [[User:Ht|Ht]] 00:47, 28 May 2012 (UTC)
