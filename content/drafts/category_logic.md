Tasks in this category have to do with creation logical types, proofs, manipulation of logical values or algorithms requiring exotic logical types.

'''Mathematical logic''' (also known as '''symbolic logic''') is a subfield of [[wp:mathematics|mathematics]] with close connections to [[wp:foundations of mathematics|foundations of mathematics]], [[wp:theoretical computer science|theoretical computer science]] and [[wp:philosophical logic|philosophical logic]]. The field includes both the mathematical study of [[wp:logic|logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics.  The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of [[wp:formal system|formal system]]s and the deductive power of formal [[wp:mathematical proof|proof]] systems.

Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of [[wp:set theory|set theory]], [[wp:model theory|model theory]], [[wp:recursion theory|recursion theory]], and [[wp:proof theory|proof theory]]. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly [[wp:first-order logic|first-order logic]], and [[wp:definable set|definability]]. In computer science (particularly in the [[wp:ACM Computing Classification System|ACM Classification]]) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see [[wp:logic in computer science|logic in computer science]] for those.
