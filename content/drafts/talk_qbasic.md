It has occurred to me that perhaps QBasic should be merged into QuickBasic. Perhaps copypaste what's here to a section on the QuickBasic page, and change this page to a redirect. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 22:24, 29 September 2009 (UTC)
:That sounds ok. I think you'd be a better judge of what content needs to be copied and what differences need to be highlighted. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 01:20, 30 September 2009 (UTC)
::Okay, I'm done. Also moved QuickBasic -> [[QuickBASIC]]. Take a look, see whatcha think. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 17:17, 30 September 2009 (UTC)
: As I recall, QBASIC and QuickBasic were different branches of the same implementation of the same derivative language of BASIC.  The chief difference I remember was that QuickBasic had a compiler built-in. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 03:10, 30 September 2009 (UTC)
::Not even different branches, really. I imagine that they might very well have built QBasic from the QuickBasic sources by using defines or even something in the makefile. (QuickBasic 4.5 has some things that QBasic doesn't, mostly related to asm, includes, command$ (QB's version of argv[], sorta), and some memory stuff.) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 16:09, 30 September 2009 (UTC)
