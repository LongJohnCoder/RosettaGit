'''Tk''' (the name is short for “'''T'''ool'''k'''it”) is a library which generalizes [[GUI|graphical user interface]] operations to allow an application which uses the library to have a functional GUI in any of a variety of environments.

Tk is most commonly combined with [[Tcl]], but may be used with programs written in many other programming languages:
* [[Common Lisp]] via ltk
* [[Perl]]/TK or Tkx
* [[Prolog]]
* [[Python]]'s [[Tkinter]]
* [[Ruby]]
* [[Scheme]] via PS/Tk
* [[Standard ML]]
