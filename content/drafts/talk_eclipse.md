== Plugins? ==

AFAIK CVS integration, syntax highlighting, debugger and nearly every other feature mentioned on this page are actually plugins too. Without plugins Eclipse is a simple text editor and file browser/project manager.
:I didn't think they were since those features come with the minimum download from the website. After looking around there for a bit I see that they are plugins..I'll fix it. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 14:37, 30 January 2008 (MST)
