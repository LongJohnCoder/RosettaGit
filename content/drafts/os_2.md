[[Category:Operating Systems]]
'''OS/2''' (an IBM-ism for "'''O'''perating '''S'''ystem'''/2'''") is an operating system developed by [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]]. It was marketed as a "professional" upgrade from [[DOS]] and 16-bit [[Windows]], and was the precursor of Windows NT, leading directly to modern Windows. For a brief history of OS/2, read [[wp:OS/2|its Wikipedia entry]].

Although IBM discontinued OS/2 at the end of 2006, a third-party version called [[wp:eComStation|eComStation]] has been available for several years from Serenity Systems, and is still undergoing active development.
