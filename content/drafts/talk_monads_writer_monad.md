### J version

Very interesting to see that implementation. I must read about the history of J. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 17:16, 3 February 2016 (UTC)
: History can be a huge topic. Still, here are a few plausible starting points for some of the perspectives on J's history:
:* http://keiapl.org/anec/
:* http://keiapl.org/rhui/remember.htm
:* http://nsl.com/papers/origins.htm
:* http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ljdickey/
: I'm not sure if any of that is what you were looking for or not... --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 20:45, 3 February 2016 (UTC)
::That looks good, and it's much appreciated – thank you. Looking forward to understanding more clearly the system of 'parts of speech'. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 21:45, 3 February 2016 (UTC)
:::For that, I guess I'd start from http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/contents.htm - there's tutorial information starting from the left, and reference information on the right. And of course, focus on the parts which mention grammatical issues. Or, if that's too dense for your taste, you might be able to find something more to your liking under http://www.jsoftware.com/books/. The "J for C Programmers" pdf, for example, trys to aim at an audience with a traditional programming background. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 23:31, 3 February 2016 (UTC)
:::: tnx ! (dense is good – elaboration can exhaust :-) [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 10:22, 4 February 2016 (UTC)
