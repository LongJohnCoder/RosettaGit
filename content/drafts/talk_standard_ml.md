Ok, so I merged both articles ([[Moscow ML]] & [[MLton]]) into this one, as the other two were just two small (all the info is in the main article now). If anyone has a problem with this, feel free to unmerge them, but well, I just think it's a waste...

Also, as they have been merged, both articles now redirect to [[Standard ML]], as to not break any links. --[[User:CrashandDie|CrashandDie]] 16:02, 25 January 2007 (EST)
