== Is this supposed to be a task? ==

Is this supposed to be a new task or just an example of modified Simpsons rule pseudocode? --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 15:02, 28 September 2018 (UTC)

: If it is a (draft) task, then it is missing a <strike>lot of</strike> few pieces, namely:
:::*   the task's requirements (what to do, what to display)
:::*   what input(s) to use so that others can show similar examples
:::*   a sample implementation (computer programming language entry)  
:::*   some sample output so other outputs can be compared

== Surname of author of "Modification 4" paper ==

Shouldn't the surname of the author be '''Lyness''' rather than '''Lychee'''? --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 19:01, 30 September 2018 (UTC)
