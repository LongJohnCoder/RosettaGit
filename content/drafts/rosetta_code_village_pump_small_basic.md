|summary=Microsoft Small Basic doesn't appear in the language section}}
Microsoft Small Basic doesn't appear in the language section and in the unimplemented tasks by language, but there is en category entry for it (actually there is another one called Small Basic and another called SmallBasic). is this an error?

:Not an error really, more a lack of someone expending the time and effort to fill in the stub pages. In order for 'Whatever' to show up in the Languages list, there needs to be a Category:Whatever page, and on that page there needs to be a <nowiki>{{language|Whatever}}</nowiki> block. (There's lots of other information that can be included in the language block, see other entries for details.) BTW, it appears that Microsoft Small Basic and SmallBasic are two different implementations of Basic, not different names for the same one. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 12:37, 7 February 2018 (UTC)

::[[Small Basic]] was indeed an error; I have changed it into something of a disambiguation page. [[SmallBASIC]] and [[:Category:Microsoft Small Basic|Microsoft Small Basic]] are completely unrelated; for details, you can see either of those pages. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] ([[User talk:Eriksiers|talk]]) 18:56, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
