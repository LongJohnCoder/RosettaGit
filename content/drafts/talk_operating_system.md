== Category page? ==

This is the kind of information I'd expect to see on a language's category page, where encyclopedic information pertaining to a particular language usually shows up. In any case, this isn't a task so I don't think it should be using header templates since the the template is used for "code example" semantics (there aren't many used yet, but there will probably be more in the future). --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 03:29, 29 June 2011 (UTC)
:I agree with Mwn3d. Header templates aren't appropriate here. I've removed them. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 20:05, 15 April 2014 (UTC)
