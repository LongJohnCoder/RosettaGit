Packages in the Go sub-repositories supplement the Go standard library.  They have been developed by, or at least had some oversight from, the Go language deveopers but for various reasons have not been directly added to the Go standard library.

See the [https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/SubRepositories Go wiki] for more information.
