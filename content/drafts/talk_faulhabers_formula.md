==Preamble to Python task contains formulae invisible to most browsers==

The formulae enclosed in '''&lt;math&gt;''' tags in the Python solution are currently only visible to a minority type of browser (FireFox is the principal case) which displays formulae by local processing of MathML, and depending on the presence of certain locally installed fonts. The majority of browsers, which display formulae using the server-side graphic image, are currently showing only blank spaces, in lieu of the intended formulae, because of a piece of ill-formed HTML, generated by the MediaWiki processor. (No semicolon separating a vertical-align attribute from a height attribute).

Generation of defective HTML is typically symptomatic of the MediaWiki processor encountering something inside a &lt;math&gt; tag that is outside its range of expectations. Iterative testing using an example of the majority type of browser e.g. Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, should make it possible to restore visibility on all such browsers [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 19:26, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
