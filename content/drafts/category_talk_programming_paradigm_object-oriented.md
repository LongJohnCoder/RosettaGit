How much encouragement is a language supposed to provide, for OO programming, to fit this paradigm?

In other words, which of the categories of languages listed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_oriented_programming#OOP_languages would fit here?

:My guess (because there are no rules about it other than wikiconsensus) is that if it's possible to use a paradigm in a language, it is practical to use that paradigm at least on occasion, and the official language documentation explicitly speaks of it, then it fits. Beyond that I think it's up to the community to decide whether a language fits a paradigm or not. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 16:22, 22 April 2010 (UTC)
