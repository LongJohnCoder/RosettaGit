== Why all the <strike>obsolescent</strike> apostrophes? ==
The wikipedia page referenced doesn't even mention the apostrophe form, and it's no longer standard practice anywhere I've ever lived, including on the Internet.  The dictionary doesn't even require an apostrophe in 'nth' anymore. --[[User:TimToady|TimToady]] ([[User talk:TimToady|talk]]) 16:07, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
:Could we <i>please</i> drop the spurious apostrophe here?  Searching around for support for it finds pretty much nothing.  Regardless of the task description, I am going to remove all the apostrophes from the Perl 6 entry as an act of civil disobedience. I dare you to mark it incorrect... <tt>:-)</tt> --[[User:TimToady|TimToady]] ([[User talk:TimToady|talk]]) 03:54, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
:In fact, doing a bit more research, it looks like it was never the correct form to use apostrophes, so I'll strike out the "obsolescent". --[[User:TimToady|TimToady]] ([[User talk:TimToady|talk]]) 04:29, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

:I am tempted to add an "apostrophes are optional ''to allow for correct english''" clause and leave it (hobbled), like that. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 06:34, 23 March 2014 (UTC)
::Very well. As for me I never heard about such apostrophes. Should 'correct' English be 'Olde' English ? --[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 13:21, 23 March 2014 (UTC)
::I'm not a native speaker but the apostrophes look strange to me too. Out of curiosity: What was the intention for having them there? --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 21:51, 23 March 2014 (UTC)
