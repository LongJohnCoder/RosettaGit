[[Category:Ada_Versions]]'''Ada 2012''' is the latest language revision defined by the [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=61507 ISO/IEC 8652] standard. The latest version of the standard was published in 2012.

The language received more [[Java]]-like features to support shorter notation. It also gained a more effective and standardized way to define predicates and compiler-related attributes of types and procedures.
