[[Category:Encyclopedia]]The '''American National Standards Institute''' ('''ANSI''') oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States. Most notably (for the purposes of RC), ANSI standardizes [[:Category:Programming Languages|programming language]] syntax and implementation. One of the most commonly known language standardizations is ANSI [[:Category:C|C]] (currently [[wp:C99|C99]]). ANSI has also released standards for things like pools, paper size, impact resistance of protective eyewear, and an extension of [[wp:ASCII|ASCII]].
