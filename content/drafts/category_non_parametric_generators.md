A non-parametric generator is an executable entity, function or procedure that contains code that yields a single generation of values from a sequence. Each time a generator is invoked, the next value in the sequence is provided.

Generators are often used in situations where a sequence is potentially infinite, and where it is possible to construct the next value of the sequence with only minimal state.

Examples of generator applications include:

* Generation of mathematical sequences
* Generation of unique invoice or ticket numbers
* Random and pseudorandom number generators

Note that non-parametric generators do not require a parameter to return the next value in sequence. However, there may be a reset mechanism that causes the generator to start again from the beginning of the sequence when next invoked.
