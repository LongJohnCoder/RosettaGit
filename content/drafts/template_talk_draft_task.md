What are the rules about when this template should be used?

For example, should we wait until four languages have provided implementations (which is necessary for the automated table of contents to show up) as one of the conditions necessary before this status gets removed?  --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 20:12, 9 February 2011 (UTC)
:There are no rules really. It's a touchy-feely thing. When it feels like there are "enough" implementations and the task description isn't changing too much anymore then you can remove it. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:41, 9 February 2011 (UTC)

: I tend to feel that “enough” implementations is about four, provided they're properly distinct from each other. Thus a C solution that compiled and worked with C++ wouldn't be distinct, but two solutions that are idiomatic in both languages (and thus very unlikely to be the same due to the way those languages have diverged) would indeed satisfy. Mind you, it's even better if you've got Haskell and (at least one of) Ruby/Perl/Python/Tcl solutions as well; with those, it's getting to the point where it's reasonable to assume that the task is practically achievable across a wide range of languages. (I choose 4 because that's the point where a TOC gets added automatically.) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:55, 10 February 2011 (UTC)

:: Four sounds good, but it should still be a "touchy-feely thing", as sometimes you write the task, and because you think it is so simple/straight-forward/well-done, you might ''choose'' to have it as a task before the four mark; and vice-versa their may still be issues after four implementation languages. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 18:59, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
