Can we count this as a [[:Category:Programming Paradigms|programming paradigm]]? And maybe get more text on here about it? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 02:29, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
: That depends on what is meant under "paradigm". Real-time computing is programming under certain non-functional constraints (time constraints). That makes things a lot more difficult, but that is not a paradigm meant as the most general approach to solving programming problems. But I agree that real-time programming looks OK in this category. Rather the category's name is wrong. Instead of "paradigm" it should be something else, maybe, "area", "field" of programming. --[[User:Dmitry-kazakov|Dmitry-kazakov]] 07:11, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
:: Domain?  Or is its application of the term too orthogonal to that of, e.g., document description or expert systems? --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 09:17, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
: I'd say that real-time constraints are orthogonal to programming paradigm.  For example, it would fall under the "Intended Use" column of the [[Language Comparison Table]]. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 17:14, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
