== Potential improvements ==
* Output a table of (t<sub>n</sub>,y<sub>n</sub>) instead of (t<sub>n</sub>,y<sub>n-1</sub>).
* Output (t<sub>a</sub>,y<sub>a</sub>) and (t<sub>b</sub>,y<sub>b</sub>) athe the top and bottom of the table.
* Provide as input a the desired numerical error bound of output.
* Produce a numerical bound on the results numerical error.
* Generalise to ℝ<sub>n</sub>.
* Handle cases where the step (h) does not fit perfectly into the range [a:b], especially where the range is [a:nh+ε]
* Accumulate the round off error in the sum, and amend/improve the final.

==Several formulae made invisible by cosmetic edit at 19:49, 22 July 2016 ==

Various formulae on this task page have become invisible to many browsers (all those - the majority - which display the graphic file rather than processing the MathML directly), as a result of under-tested 'tidying and spacing' edits made at 19:49, 22 July 2016. One of the issues is an attempt at cosmetic introduction of redundant white space around Latex expressions inside &lt;math&gt; tags. This white space is not currently expected by the MediaWiki processor, and leads to the generation of syntactically ill-formed HTML.
