{{Vptopic
|topic=Minimum penetration
|summary=This page deals with issues relating to languages that do not (or cannot) achieve a certain fraction of tasks.
}}
The two languages [[LaTeX]] and [[plainTeX]] in their "Task not implemented in ..." page have as % of task implemented or omitted the absurd number 18446744073709551614%. --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 23:51, 3 July 2009 (UTC)

The language [[M4]] has a completely wrong value (3% instead of what I'm guessing should be around 15%).  Looks like a bug. --[[User:Rpk|Rpk]] 00:57, 7 September 2009 (UTC)
