We should coordinate to avoid cases when a person is about to commit a finished solution but finds out one has already been sent. Kinda frustrating. [[User talk:foobie-bletch|Foobie Bletch]] 23:38, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
:1. If you care, post your incomplete solution with a note you're working on it.
:2. Independent solutions can each have useful insights; figure out what they don't have in common and think about how to integrate it. This goes double for ''explanation'' rather than code.
