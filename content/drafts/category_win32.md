{{library}}
With Microsoft [[Windows]], the Win32 [[API]] is the core interface to the operating system. Win32 programs call functions in a core set of DLL libraries. Win32 is for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. (Old programs that run in 16-bit mode are not using Win32.)

[[C]] and [[C++]] programs can call every Win32 function. (You need the header files and import libraries for your C or C++ compiler.) Some other languages provide some way to make Win32 API calls.
