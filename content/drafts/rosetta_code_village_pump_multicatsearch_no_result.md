}}
Currently, it's possible to see <code><multicatsearch_no_result></code> on "Tasks not implemented" pages in sections that contain 0 pages, such as [[Tasks not implemented in HQ9+]] (at bottom, first two sections are always filled in - the problem is about sections below those). The <code><multicatsearch_no_result></code> is implementation detail - it isn't natural. Apparently, fixing this means just updating [[mw:Extension:Multi-Category_Search|Extension:Multi-Category_Search]]. --[[User:GlitchMr|GlitchMr]] 12:13, 7 October 2012 (UTC)
