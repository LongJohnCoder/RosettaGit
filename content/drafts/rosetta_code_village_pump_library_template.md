{{Vptopic
|topic=Library template
|summary=Question on the wording of a sentence in the library template.
}}Adding a stub for [[:Category:pthread|pthread]] I noticed that the text added by <nowiki>{{library}}</nowiki> is rather strange to me: "This is an example of a library" shouldn't it be simply "This is a library" (used by examples)...? Otherwise it seems the template can be used in RC task pages that "create" a library, or similar. --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 23:32, 11 April 2009 (UTC)
