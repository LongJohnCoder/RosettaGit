This problem appears to be very similar to the problem "Sort an array using a custom comparator". Please explain the difference.

Could this be renamed "Sort an associative array"?  If not, why not?  Waldorf's question is similar and good. The sorting tasks may deserve broader reassessment. --[[User:TBH|TBH]] 15:04, 10 January 2008 (MST)

: No it couldn't, because it's not an associative array (it still is indexed with a numeric index). It could be part of an associative array implementation, though.
: According to Waldorf's comment: This is indeed not just similar, but a special case of sorting using a custom iterator. Unless some language provides explicit support for sorting for a structure field, this task doesn't give you anything new compared with the other task, except maybe for structure element access (but for that, IMHO a more basic task should be created). --[[User:Ce|Ce]] 12:56, 11 January 2008 (MST)
