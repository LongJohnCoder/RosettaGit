==Overstatement==

The description of this task has too specific a definition of "event" without noting any other. In particular, it talks about event-driven GUI systems, but its "event" is not the same as the typical GUI "event", which is an object carrying information and not a concurrency tool. 

I am not (at this time) requesting a change in the technical requirements of the ''task''; I am asking that the text used to describe it be revised to acknowledge the specific sense of "event" being used here, and that many/most GUI systems are using a different kind of "event". --[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 23:07, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
