I would like to see a new requirement of this task: to pass arguments to the constructor of the base class. All the object-oriented languages I know can do this, but the syntax is different. --[[Special:Contributions/128.97.245.51|128.97.245.51]] 01:00, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

: I'm tempted to say that that should be another task, so that we have the inheritance itself separated from the constructor chaining. At least when it comes to fundamental features, small clear steps are better IMO than complicated mixing of everything together. â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 23:26, 7 June 2009 (UTC)
