{{library}}
[[wp:ncurses|''ncurses'']] is one implementation of the [[:Category:curses|''curses'']] library.

'''Attention:''' All programs that use curses should appear in [[:Category:curses]], not this category, ''unless'' there exists some ''specific reason'' that the program ''must'' use ncurses and not any other implementation of curses.

This category should probably be empty.
