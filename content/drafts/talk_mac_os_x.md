The encyclopedia entry should be under the full product name, not the casual abbreviation. --[[User:TBH|TBH]] 12:44, 10 January 2008 (MST)
:I think either way works. The company even  says "mac" in their own commercials and on their boxes. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 12:53, 10 January 2008 (MST)
::Since languages support environments rather than computers or companies, perhaps this link should be named [[Mac OS X]] instead. After all, there is no "Apple Computer". The corporation runs no code, and Apple made many incompatible computers (Apple ][, Mac OS Classic, Newton, Mac OS X). --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 10:13, 11 January 2008 (MST)
:::I agree that OS is a better focus than company name. The page should be named [[Macintosh OS X]]. --10:27, 11 January 2008 (MST)
::::Disagree on name. ''Everyone'' in the industry calls it "Mac OS X", including Apple. All references I could find here on Rosetta Code also use the abbreviation. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 11:12, 11 January 2008 (MST)
:::::OK!  I give up.  :)  --TBH

== Merge with Mac OS? ==

I reviewed this page and [[Mac OS]] (yes, I wrote that one), and I think that perhaps the content here should be merged into the other one, with my info on older versions given in a "pre-X" section or something, and then changing this one to a redirect (and changing the current redirects appropriately). If that sounds good, I'm willing to do it. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 21:12, 27 October 2009 (UTC)
:I'll upvote that. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 01:01, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
::Agreed. â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 09:23, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
:::Done. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 15:30, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
:Disagree. As I said above, Apple and the rest of the industry call it "Mac OS X". The old OS (and its simulator) is called "Mac OS Classic". But I guess I'm too late into this argument. :) --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 20:01, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
::My reasoning is based on personal experience. In the geeky places I frequent, both on- and offline, if a person mentions "Mac OS", it's generally understood that they're talking about either OSX, or the entire Mac OS line in general. (Context rules all.) To talk about pre-X versions, one would say "pre-X Mac OS" or "classic Mac OS", or refer to a specific version (i.e. "OS 8" or "System 6" or whatever). -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 21:58, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
: Agree, but reluctantly.  Technically speaking, Mac OS X is Mac OS X, and Mac OS is Mac OS.  However, with the obsolescence of Mac OS and its virtual disappearance from the market and the attentions of programmers, people (notably those not old enough to remember Mac OS) looking for and considering programming resources will be thinking along the same lines that Eriksiers observed.  For supporting analogy, one doesn't normally include Win16 in discussions of writing for Windows, or even Windows 9x, for that matter. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 23:16, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
::Funny thing is, I don't even ''own'' a copy of OSX (newest version I have is OS 8; kinda hard to run OS X on a 68k Mac) but I ''do'' still use Win16. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 23:28, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
::: Win16 is primarily used in embedded environments these days, isn't it? --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 03:20, 29 October 2009 (UTC)
::::No idea. I haven't done anything professionally for several years. I use [[wp:Windows 3.1x#Windows_for_Workgroups|Windows for Workgroups]] (under VMware) for testing 16-bit support in a ''very'' few of my toy projects. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 14:41, 29 October 2009 (UTC)
::::: I don't know enough about your projects to make the appropriate queries, but I'm now extremely curious... --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 16:33, 29 October 2009 (UTC)
::::::I don't have very many GUI projects, actually, and ''most'' I haven't bothered porting to Win16. [http://eeshell.sourceforge.net/ EEShell2] has a 16-bit version in (slow) progress -- by request, even. (It's technically usable, but not quite what it's supposed to be. I'm having problems with certain things in Win16 that are dead easy in Win32.) I also wrote a cheat program for the old DOS game [[wp:Eye of the Beholder (video game)]] several years ago that ''started'' as Win16, but was moved to Win32 before long.
::::::(I also use the same VM for testing my DOS stuff in "real" DOS, so I don't have to reboot.) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 17:17, 29 October 2009 (UTC)
::::::: You might find [[wp:Win32s|Win32s]] to be helpful. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 20:06, 29 October 2009 (UTC)
::::::::I had considered it, but the request was specifically for a 16-bit version. <nowiki>[shrug]</nowiki> I'm not worried about it, really. My priorities ''definitely'' don't include trying to get Win16 stuff working, and AFAIK the Win32 version ''does'' work with Win32s. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 21:26, 29 October 2009 (UTC)
