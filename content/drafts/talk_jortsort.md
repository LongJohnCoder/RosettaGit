{{alertbox|#f1c40f|jortSort is considered a work of satire. It achieves its result in an intentionally roundabout way. You are encouraged to write your solutions in the spirit of the original rather than trying to give the most concise or idiomatic solution.}}

It is not a sort. (It just involves sorting). --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 09:59, 4 March 2015 (UTC)
: jortSort is a satirical program. It's meant to be a completely ridiculous and roundabout way of "sorting" (which is achieved by telling the user that their input needs to be sorted). Since the implementation was given a name by its creator, I don't think we have the freedom to change the name. [[User:Dstaley|Dstaley]] ([[User talk:Dstaley|talk]]) 17:24, 4 March 2015 (UTC)

::This, together with the request for "satirical", non-idiomatic solutions in the manner of the video i think should be made clear at the head of the task description so readers know the reason for the bad code and don't automatically try and improve it, (RC normally tries for good code). --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 17:54, 4 March 2015 (UTC)
:::I agree that adding the notice at the beginning of the task description is helpful. I'll look into seeing if I can make the alert not create such a large whitespace. [[User:Dstaley|Dstaley]] ([[User talk:Dstaley|talk]]) 20:16, 4 March 2015 (UTC)
