==Reorganizing Collections==
So now that [[RCBF]] and the like have been reorganized to look like normal tasks, the subpages and the main pages end up in the language categories. That doesn't seem right. It's inflating the category counts of languages that have subpages, especially when there are languages with solutions that are small enough to leave on the main collection page. I think we need to remove the category links from the subpages. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 21:33, 27 December 2009 (UTC)
: Seems reasonable to me. It makes them follow the pattern used on some other RC pages, namely that of spilling examples to a subpage when they're too long. While we're at it, they can be renamed to be clearer in what they're doing (e.g., “RCBF” to “BF Interpreter”).
: Once it's all done, I'll then be able to remove the weird hacks I've got in my page counter code to handle these collections. ☺ –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 23:33, 27 December 2009 (UTC)
