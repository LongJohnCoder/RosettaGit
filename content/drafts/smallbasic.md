{{implementation|BASIC}}

'''SmallBASIC''' (not to be confused with [[:Category:Microsoft Small Basic|Microsoft Small Basic]]) is a [[:Category:BASIC|BASIC]] interpreter, originally intended for use on the [[wp:Palm (PDA)|Palm line of PDAs]], and currently available for [[:Category:POSIX|POSIX]]-compliant systems (including [[Linux]], [[Unix]], [[Mac OS|Mac OSX]], and [[BSD]]), [[Windows]], [[DOS]], and several lesser-known systems.

SmallBASIC is fairly similar to [[QuickBASIC#QBasic|QBasic]], although many keywords are different (for example, <code>DO</code> works significantly different in the two languages).
