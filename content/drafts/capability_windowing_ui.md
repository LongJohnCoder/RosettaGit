{{Capability}}
A windowing UI is anything which allows you to open and manage several windows with different content, where the windows can be opened, rearranged and closed independently. Most commonly today the windowing UI will be a GUI, but there are also text based windowing UIs, e.g. Turbo Vision from Turbo Pascal/Turbo C. Note that having a windowing UI doesn't imply having graphics.
