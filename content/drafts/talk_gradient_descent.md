== Needs more information ==
This needs a description, purpose and preferably, a given function to solve for so that different implementations can be compared. Changed to draft status until that is supplied. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 12:30, 1 July 2019 (UTC)
:Luckily, I managed to find a freely available book excerpt (from Google books) which contained the C# code from which the first Typescript example had been translated together with some explanation of what was being done here.

:I've therefore added a rudimentary task description and a Go translation to start the ball rolling. --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 17:48, 8 July 2019 (UTC)
 
== promoted from draft? ==
I thought it was normal for a task to be a draft task until at least four (or so) examples have been entered, and also wait
a week or so before promoting it.   I know there are no hard and fast rules.     -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 19:21, 1 July 2019 (UTC)

:In general, I wait for a minimum of 3 months and 20 implementations before I promote one of my tasks out of draft. That way there is plenty of opportunity for discussion and tweaks if necessary. As far as I'm concerned, this doesn't even rise to the level of a draft yet, let alone a full task. Reverted back to draft (again). --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 20:57, 1 July 2019 (UTC)
