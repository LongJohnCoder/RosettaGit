I added the [[Special:NewsChannel|News Channel]] extension, looking for a way to provide better wiki-specific RSS feeds than just the changelog.  I ''think'' it's configured on the server properly, but I'm not sure how to use it.  Everyone (currently) has access to create feeds.  If you figure out how to use it, post instructions and the feeds you created.  To avoid completely overwhelming my SliceHost account, please post the feeds as run through [http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home FeedBurner]. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 03:59, 23 January 2009 (UTC)
