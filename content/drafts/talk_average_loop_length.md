==Analytical formula?==
Hi, the task needs the analytical formula to be stated as part of the task description rather than leaving it to be discovered. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 15:53, 4 January 2013 (UTC)
: I've watched the lecture; the problem in question is in the last 10 minutes and is only mentioned in passing. IIRC, it is at about 1:32:00 (and I forgot to note it down). If you've got the time though, it's ''well'' worth watching the whole thing, and the mathematics involved is extremely simple (yet talks about some very interesting properties of sequences). â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:54, 9 January 2013 (UTC)
