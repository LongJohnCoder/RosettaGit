== draft task ==

Please describe the algorithm and the required example(s) on the task page itself. See also: [[Rosetta_Code:Add_a_Task#Basic_information|Add a Task -- Basic information]]. (And reviewing the rest of that page might also be a good idea). --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 05:11, 10 October 2015 (UTC)
: Looks like a drive-by contribution. Is it too late to specify an input so that everybody works with the same data? Maybe the wikipedia example (two entries already use that). [[User:Fwend|Fwend]] ([[User talk:Fwend|talk]]) 01:12, 13 April 2016 (UTC)
:: Go for it. (Thanks) --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 01:51, 13 April 2016 (UTC)

::: Er... now, the task says "Print the pair, the distance and the path." But the wikipedia [[wp:Floyd–Warshall_algorithm|Floyd–Warshall algorithm]] page says "A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, though it does not return details of the paths themselves."
::: Wikipedia does include a Floyd Warshall Path Reconstruction algorithm in with its description of the Floyd Warshall algorithm itself, but I think that these are two different algorithms and the more involved algorithm should be a separate task. Do you feel up to creating that separate task page? --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 21:41, 13 April 2016 (UTC)
