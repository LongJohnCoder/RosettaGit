This is a request to document how to run the snippets provided somewhere (At least once in the main language page if all samples use the same format.). 
It would help others test and validate your snippets more easily. For e.g I am having a hard time figuring out how to run 
(and print the result of )[http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Prime_decomposition#Haskell Haskell Prime decomposition].

:I agree, having hard time trying to run Objective-C (Cocoized) code... ([[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]])
:It may end up being on implementation pages rather than language pages. If a language is implemented a little bit differently a lot of times, the language page would get crowded that way. You'll have to make sure to make your examples with the correct implementation name also. I'm pretty sure the [[Template:Works with|works with template]] will link to implementation pages as well as libraries. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:15, 11 December 2008 (UTC)
