==Copying from Wikipedia==

As you may already know, wikipedia supplies samples of code in 'pseudocode'. Would it make sense to copy these across from wiki to here (placed in its own 'pseudocode language section). Maybe then others may use these as a base for translating them into one of the 'usable' codes. There shouldn't be any legal issues in doing this, should there? --[[User:Oatzy|Oatzy]] 18:47, 25 January (GMT)
:As a blanket rule, if you copy from Wikipedia, include a citation with a link to the specific version of the page copied from. I don't know that the GFDL requires it, but ''I'' will. :-) I'll mention this in the [[Rosetta Code:Copyrights]] page. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 13:57, 25 January 2007 (EST)

==Upgrade==

Upgraded MediaWiki from 1.9 to 1.11.  Let me know if something's broken that I didn't fix. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 22:45, 28 October 2007 (MDT)
: Yeah, the expression templates like #if aren't working. Did you forget to reinstall the '''ParserFunctions''' extension? See [[FizzBuzz]] for example. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 02:49, 29 October 2007 (MDT)
:: Should be working now.  The upgrade process completely borked my settings, so I'd had to recreate at them based on a diff.  I missed the extensions lines. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 08:31, 29 October 2007 (MDT)
:: Ah, crud.  While I was asleep, we got a ton of spam.  Onward, Bureaucrats! :-) --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 08:32, 29 October 2007 (MDT)

==Kudos==
Just wanted to give kudos to [[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] for going through and switching the remainder of the pages to use Template:Header, and to [[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] for going back and cleaning up Mwn3d's and my messes. Take a 100pt patch each. :-) --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 13:07, 13 November 2007 (MST)
