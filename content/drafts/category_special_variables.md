Tasks in this category demonstrate application and utilization of special variables. These are variables that have a reserved special meaning within a programming language.

== Types of special variables ==

Depending on the programming language being used, there are generally two types of special variable:


###  Control variables 


Control variables contain operational parameters used within the program. These variables can be modified to control the way that the program will behave.


###  Informative variables 


Informative variables provide information about current status within the program. These special variables are generally read only and cannot be directly modified by assignment from within the program.
