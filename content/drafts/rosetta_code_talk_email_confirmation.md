Looks like someone's worked around that. Pity. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:26, 26 March 2012 (UTC)
: Shouldn't be as much of a problem as it had been, though. With that massive flood, I was able to identify and block their netblocks. Six IPv4 /24s so far, and six IPv4 /32s (which I think are deliberate sources, based on how evenly far apart they are in their network addresses). I can see them hammering on the firewall logs. I can also see a couple other anti-spam extensions I need to install, but I'm not going to have time until next Sunday, most likely. Also, based on the pattern and type of spam, I think it was only one group out of several we've seen around here. That group tended to concentrate their spam efforts on Sunday night, and never wrote to their own user pages. It remains to be seen whether the customary nightly trickle of 3-4 spam posts will return. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 12:18, 26 March 2012 (UTC)
