This is the first in a series of pages attempting to split up the chaos of the [[Sorting]] task.  I've included my own examples for C, Haskell, Java, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, and UNIX Shell, and copied the relevant C++ examples from Sorting, with some small changes.

The other tasks I'm thinking of are "Sorting objects in natural order" and "Sorting with a custom comparator" (basically the original task given in Sorting).  None of these are related to [[:Category:Sorting Algorithms|Sorting Algorithms]]; rather, they exist to demonstrate built-in functionality.

Once these are in place, all code examples will be removed from Sorting, and it will hold only general information and links to related tasks (and the algorithms category).

:I've added "Sorting with a custom comparator".  I decided against "Sorting objects in natural order" since any language capable of that has probably already used it here.  I'll give the new page a little while to grow before purging Sorting. --[[User:Bob9000|Bob9000]] 06:02, 30 January 2007 (EST)

I removed the AppleScript example, pending a response from Apple.  Here's the email I sent:
