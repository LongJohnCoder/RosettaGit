|summary=Web browser cannot access rosettacode.

Hi, since about one week or too, I can not access to rosettacode from my home. My web-browser gives an error message in my born language, so a translation could be "the server refuses the connection" and also "the server of rosettacode.org has rejected the attempt of connection from this computer". So ? What happens ? What should I do to be able to browse and contribute again to my favorite website ? [[User:Blue Prawn|Blue Prawn]] 15:38, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
:I had a problem in Firefox recently where it would default to HTTPS for the site. I couldn't use my history links for it. I had to manually type <nowiki>"http://rosettacode.org"</nowiki> to get it to use normal HTTP. I also got an error message like that one. I wonder if this is your problem. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:43, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
::Make sure to visit '''rosettacode.org''' and not ''www.rosettacode.org''. If you try ''www.rosettacode.org'', it will refuse the connection. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 15:50, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
:::No, this is not the problem. I can really NOT access to rosettacode from my home anymore. [[User:Blue Prawn|Blue Prawn]] 17:25, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
::::Can you ping it? Does it resolve in DNS? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 17:27, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
:I'm going to send you an email address directly. I probably blocked you by mistake. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 17:39, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
