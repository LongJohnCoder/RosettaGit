Rosetta Code does not have a language called specifically '''Small Basic'''. There are, however, two unrelated languages:
*'''[[SmallBASIC]]''', a language originally created for [[wp:Palm OS|Palm OS]] and now available for [[Windows]], [[Linux]], [[DOS]], and a few other systems.
*'''[[:Category:Microsoft Small Basic|Microsoft Small Basic]]''', a language largely aimed at beginners that runs on the [[.Net Framework]].
