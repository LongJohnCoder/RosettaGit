: ''CL-FAD (for "Files and Directories") is a thin layer atop Common Lisp's standard pathname functions. It is intended to provide some unification between current CL implementations on Windows, OS X, Linux, and Unix.''

CL-FAD is written and maintained by [http://weitz.de/ Edi Weitz], a creator of well-regarded Common Lisp libraries.
