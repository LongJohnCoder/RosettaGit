Latest in a campaign of junk task and spurious link creation from behind a login credential evasion service. Presumably a spamming beachhead exercise.

: I changed it to a redirect to the implicit type conversion page. That's not an exact match for the title of this page, but without a task description it's as good a match as anything else. But if someone wants to turn this into a [[Rosetta_Code:Add_a_Task|real task page]] that would also be fine. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 05:22, 11 October 2015 (UTC)
