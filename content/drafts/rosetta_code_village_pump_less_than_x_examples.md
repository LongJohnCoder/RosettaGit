What's the story on these "Less Than X Examples" categories (see [[:Category:Examples_needing_attention]])? Are we actually going to use them or should we ask for someone to try to make a bot for them? Also, if we are going to use them, shouldn't they be in [[:Category:Tasks needing attention]]? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:59, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

I personally think that this kind of thing should be done via queries like other special pages, not via categories which have to be manually updated every so often. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 02:50, 30 January 2009 (UTC)

Bringing this back up. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 01:29, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

It would be good if there was a way to find out this sort of information. (I suggest that getting at least 4 examples is a good target, since that guarantees that there will be a table of contents offered with default settings.) Mind you, rather than working on this I'd rather people went through and actually did examples. Metawork is a great way to spin on the spot. â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 09:10, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
: ImplSearchBot already has the data for calculating things like these, but generating report pages is/will be simpler than adding and removing to/from categories.  I've given up trying to predict when I'll be able to modify it, but if someone were to send me a patch, that would at least speed things up. [[User:Foobie-bletch|Foobie-bletch]] made an attempt a couple weeks ago, but then indicated it might to do a complete rewrite. (I'm working on cleaning it up.  It just takes...time.) --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 16:00, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
:So, is this done yet ? --12:46, 12 November 2014 (UTC)
