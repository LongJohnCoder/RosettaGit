Anyone know of a working soap server we can test against ? --[[User:Tinku99|Tinku99]] 15:16, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
: Write me a low-cost, low-resource, low-footprint sample server, and I'll host it. (Consider creating a task of that, FWIW) --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 19:16, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

'''AutoHotkey:''' Example should be rewritten with [http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic22923.html COM standard library]

Should this task be renamed to "Soap client"? or what about "Soap/Client"? --[[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 16:09, 8 June 2011 (UTC)
