I'd like to leave this in the encyclopedia category because "Memoization" has encyclopedic content, but the pages in [[:Category:Memoization]] don't (necessarily). It's the same setup and reasoning as [[Recursion]]. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 21:06, 5 March 2011 (UTC)
:Maybe it would make sense to move the cat's content here (and remove the <nowiki>#REDIRECT</nowiki>), and add a wp-ish "The main page for this category is <nowiki>[[Memoization]]</nowiki>" (or something) on the cat page. Then leave this page in the Encyclopedia, with a link to the cat under "See also". How's that sound to you?
:I just did a mock-up at [[Sandbox#Memoization]] and [[Sandbox#Category:Memoization]] so you can see what I have in mind. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 21:57, 5 March 2011 (UTC)
