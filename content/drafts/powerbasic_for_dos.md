{{implementation|PowerBASIC}}

'''PowerBASIC for DOS''' (a.k.a. '''PB/DOS''') is the [[DOS]] compiler for [[:Category:PowerBASIC|PowerBASIC]].

Unlike the [[Windows]] versions of PowerBASIC, PB/DOS is very similar to [[QBasic]] and other, older [[Microsoft]] [[:Category:BASIC|BASIC]]s, and PB/DOS can in fact compile most QBasic and [[:Category:GW-BASIC|GW-BASIC]] programs unchanged. ([[PB/Win]] and [[PB/CC]] use a variation of BASIC that is somewhat similar to [[:Category:Visual Basic|Visual Basic]].)
