==Split?==
Should this task be split into five small tasks? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 08:19, 12 July 2014 (UTC)

:Don't think so, since there's so much commonality between the subtasks that can be factored out, for instance, all the tier logic.  It also nicely shows the similarities and differences between the subtasks.  --[[User:TimToady|TimToady]] ([[User talk:TimToady|talk]]) 03:21, 27 August 2014 (UTC)

==Ruby all-in-one solution==
The Ruby solution doesn't meet the task requirements and I marked it incorrect ''but'', it would be acceptable if it were preceded by an example ''"...that apply one, each, of the following ranking methods..."''. You could then keep the current version with an explanation of how it differs from the spec, but is nonetheless interesting. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 19:55, 25 August 2014 (UTC)

I would like to make clear my intention that sepate functions be used for each ranking method. This would require both Ruby and Tcl be updated. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 15:02, 7 September 2014 (UTC)
