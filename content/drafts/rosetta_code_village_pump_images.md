{{Vptopic
|topic=images
|summary=linked images to page/section
}}
Is there a way to insert an image (in this case, a bit of a screencap showing the output of the sample program) into the section for a task/language, and host the image on this site, rather than linking ofsite?  Or is there a preferred place to host images?

Thanks.
