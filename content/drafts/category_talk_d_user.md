"This is a list of users on Rosetta Code who say they can use D with any level of proficiency."

Does that mean "if you know any D", or "you have to master all levels of D"?
:"Any level of proficiency". It matches up with the [[Template:Mylang|Mylang]] templates made for user pages. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 16:59, 18 January 2009 (UTC)
