Not quite sure whether this counts as a "similar site" (hence posted here instead of the main page): http://amath.colorado.edu/computing/mmm/  It compares only for languages and is only updated "whenever the author feels like it". But for the four languages in question it's handy to have at hand... I'll leave it to the community to decide whether this should count... ;-)  [[User:Sgeier|Sgeier]] 17:06, 27 September 2007 (MDT)

codecodex link is probably broken (403 on main page). I will remove it if it continues to be inaccessible for a longer time.[[User:Rahul|Rahul]] 09:50, 8 October 2008 (UTC)
: Their admin's phone number is listed in the WHOIS database.  I'll give him a call and see what's up, and if there's anything I can do to help.  Barring that, maybe they can redirect here. :-) --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 06:30, 12 October 2008 (UTC)

== Stop losing links... ==

I don't like that some of the sites we're linking to are dropping offline without presence on the [http://www.archive.org/about/faqs.php#The_Wayback_Machine Wayback Machine], so I'd like to see the pages we listing and document here get added there. In order to get a site documented, however, it apparently must find its way [http://www.alexa.com/help/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=35&sid=e64843be19de0f584b552f009f6e492c onto Alexa], which is a copy of DMOZ--and they have their own [http://www.dmoz.org/add.html submission guidelines]. Would someone care to take on familiarizing themselves with DMOZ's submission guidelines, and follow those as they add the links we have under Similar Sites? It would be nice to be able to link to Archive.org's backup in case the sites went down in the future. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 17:09, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

What about http://projecteuler.net/? &mdash; [[User:Ht|Ht]] 04:36, 16 May 2012 (UTC)

== How to add to Online Execution table? ==

I'd like to add the MiniScript Try-It! site (http://miniscript.org/tryit) to the Online Execution table, but when I edit the page, the actual content for that table is nowhere to be found.  Can anyone explain how to edit that?  --[[User:JoeStrout|JoeStrout]] ([[User talk:JoeStrout|talk]]) 15:17, 17 June 2019 (UTC)

:I'm a little puzzled as to what you are referring to. Do you mean [[Online_code_execution|this page]]? If so, you should be able to edit that directly as long as you are logged in. That page isn't really easy to find though, and may not help much. It may be more useful for you to just put an infobox on the [[:Category:MiniScript|MiniScript]] page directly right after the language block. Something like:

:<nowiki>
{{infobox_begin}}
'''Don't want to or

'''can't install'''

'''MiniScript locally?'''

'''[http://miniscript.org/tryit Try it on-line!]'''
{{infobox_end}}
</nowiki>

:See the [[:Category:Perl_6|Perl 6]] page for an example. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 16:09, 17 June 2019 (UTC)

:(Update) If your really want to edit that table you have to go to the page itself first and edit it there. [[:Help:Similar_Sites/Online_Execution]] For some reason the edit link doesn't take you to the embedded page. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 16:31, 17 June 2019 (UTC)
