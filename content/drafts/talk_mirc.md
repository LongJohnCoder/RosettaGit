[ User comment: Isnt MSL (mIRC Scripting Language) the real name of the language? Saying that MSL is mIRC is like saying C++ is GCC, imo. ] --Anonymous

:Well, yes, you are correct, mIRC is the name of the program, and MSL is indeed the name of the language. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSL source:Wikipedia]. I don't how we have to handle changing the name of "language", or how to fix this error... But still, thanks for noticing. --[[User:CrashandDie|CrashandDie]] 14:05, 25 January 2007 (EST)
