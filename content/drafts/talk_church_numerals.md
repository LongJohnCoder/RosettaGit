###  Created a stub for a Church Numerals 


Not sure if this needs the addition of a more stretching task ? It may already not be all that easy to implement in languages with limited support for higher-order functions. In AppleScript, for example, my first sketches of churchMultiply all produce a stack overflow. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 22:09, 21 August 2018 (UTC)

===Worker-wrapper transformation in Haskell===

In response to Spoon!'s query – "not sure why `go` helper is necessary": the worker-wrapper transform is a useful reflex whenever recursion is needed. http://ku-fpg.github.io/practice/workerwrapper/ – (recursive name found in a more local namespace – often a smaller frame pushed to stack etc. etc) but no particular view on it here. Your edit looks fine. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]])


### Phix disclaimer


Disclaimer: this all feels a bit silly to me, but the intention (I am no expert on this lambda stuff) is that it shows how "closures" (or whatever) can be simulated quite easily with routine_ids and data.

: :-) It could certainly seem like a laborious route to integer arithmetic, but Peano numbers and Church encoding have an interest of their own in the history of computing theory (and even in the implementation of Smalltalk). In the Rosetta context, they can reveal the different routes which each language takes to manipulating higher-order functions.
