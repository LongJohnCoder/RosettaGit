== Why does this task require user input? ==

Requiring user input seems like task cruft to me. --[[User:Showell|Showell]] 02:08, 26 February 2012 (UTC)

: Not at all.   It is a reasonable requirement, to actually require responding to a user's invocation from the command line (or equivalent).   I never understand why some programmers are so reluctant to accept a user's input in the manner most convenient to the user, and not the computer program.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:41, 6 August 2015 (UTC)

think it's missing the exponentiation operator "**" requested by Task.--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] 04:12, 3 January 2011 (UTC)

should this "(sign from 2nd operand)" be "(sign from 1st operand)" --[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] 18:15, 26 August 2012 (UTC)

: Yes, I wrongly referred to the quotient instead of the remainder.  The sign of the result (for division) is taken from the 2nd operand (the divisor), the remainder's sign is taken from the 1st operand. I'll change the comment in the output to reflect this. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] 18:30, 26 August 2012 (UTC)
