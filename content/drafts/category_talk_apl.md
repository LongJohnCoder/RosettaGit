== viewing APL symbols ==

What type of encoding are the symbols APL uses in? It'd be nice to see the actual symbols instead of boxes. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 17:18, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
:MediaWiki and HTTP take care of the encoding; it's a matter of your having the fonts for the symbols (which are U+2336 to U+237A, plus some other characters shared with other purposes), and a browser/OS which will switch fonts as needed. --[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 18:20, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
::Try installing an [http://www.dyalog.com/downloads/fonts/Apl385.ttf Unicode font which includes APL characters]. --[[User:DanBron|DanBron]] 19:15, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
: Before talk of replacing with inline images comes up, I'd like to leave it with the Unicode characters, as that's most helpful for copy/paste into the appropriate editors.  Though a link to a page with instructions on how to see the missing symbols would be nice. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 07:07, 12 October 2008 (UTC)
