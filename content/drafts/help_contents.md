Rosetta Code has a simple concept; do many things, each in as many programming languages as possible.  While using a wiki makes it possible for everyone to participate, it isn't always obvious how to do so.  So here's some help to that effect.

Assuming you've seen the front page, you'll have noticed the links to lists of programming languages, compilers/interpreters, and programming tasks.  That's all fine and dandy, but what if what you're looking for isn't already there?

For starters, you can request that the information be added:
* [[Help:Request a new programming language|Request a new programming language]]
* [[Help:Request a new compiler/interpreter|Request a new compiler/interpreter]]
* [[Help:Request a new programming task|Request a new programming task.]]

What if you want to add the information yourself?  Well, first, let me thank you.
* [[Help:Adding a new programming language|How to add a new programming language]]
* [[Help:Adding a new compiler/interpreter|How to add a new compiler/interpreter]]
* [[Help:Adding a new programming task|How to add a new programming task]]
