==Category?==

I've written up a somewhat longer, slightly more-detailed version of this page, but before I put it up, I want to see if there's any reason not to move this to a category. There are only 2 pages that link to [[:Category:HTML]] -- [[Empty Program#HTML]] and [[Basic Animation#JavaScript + HTML]] -- and I feel that making this a category ''might'' be overkill... or it might not be. After all, there's only so much one can do with a document layout language; most examples on RC are simply beyond plain HTML's capabilities. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 23:18, 5 November 2009 (UTC)

: It probably wants to be a bit like [[JSON]]. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 11:31, 6 November 2009 (UTC)
