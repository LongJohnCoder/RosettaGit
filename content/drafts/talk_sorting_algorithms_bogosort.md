The more I look at this task, the more I think the description should have stated something like: "''Assume'' a function or procedure shuffle( ) that implements a (possibly in-place) Knuth shuffle (cf.)." Including the redundant shuffle code here distracts from the main task. But I guess it's too late now. :-)

It might also be useful to make a distinction between '''Bogosort''' (full shuffle) and '''Bozosort''' (swap only 2 random elements), since the two have different performance characteristics (both awful!). At least one example implemented Bozosort instead. --[[User:Snoman|Snoman]] 06:26, 27 July 2010 (UTC)
