[[Category:Program life cycle]]'''Run time''' refers to the execution phase of the program life cycle. The program being executed is said "running", so the time between the program start and stop is called the run time. Sometimes the term dynamic can also refer to run time.

Examples of use: run-time dispatch, run-time exception, run-time library, run-time object, dynamic [[polymorphism]], dynamic memory allocation, [[Type checking|dynamic typing]], dynamic semantics.
