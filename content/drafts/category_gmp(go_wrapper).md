[https://github.com/ncw/gmp This package] provides a drop in replacement for Go's built in math/big big integer package using the GNU Multiprecision Library (GMP) which, despite the overhead of cgo, is still much faster than the former.

Its use is subject to the [https://github.com/ncw/gmp/blob/master/LICENSE BSD 3-Clause license].
