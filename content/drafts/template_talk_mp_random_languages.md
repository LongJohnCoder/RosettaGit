This obviously isn't working properly. The reason is that Semantic MediaWiki collapses category trees into a flat list, and there's a lot of things in the Languages categories. The SMW query really needs to check against the "is task" property. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 13:36, 26 August 2010 (UTC)
