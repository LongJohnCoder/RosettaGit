Does this task mean to create an array using literals? "With data" doesn't register as anything for me. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 09:33, 4 June 2008 (MDT)

I think this page should be removed as a duplicate [[User:Grauenwolf|Grauenwolf]] 05:22, 25 December 2008 (UTC)
:I think it looks like a dupe too. Maybe it could just be changed to a redirect to [[Creating an Array]]? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 01:49, 16 April 2009 (UTC)
:I agree. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 14:56, 16 April 2009 (UTC)
::I'll leave it the way it is for another day or two in case anyone else wants to chime in. If no one else says anything I'll redirect the page. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:17, 16 April 2009 (UTC)
::: At least Fortran and Smalltalk example should be integrated into [[Creating an Array]], since they show something not shown there (should we add to the task "the goal is to create and initialize an array" or lose the code since that task does not specify how much of an array creation/initialization should be shown). Currently I have few time to do a good enough job different by copy-pasting. --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 16:46, 16 April 2009 (UTC)
:::: Times ago I've "merged" Fortran and Smalltalk original code into [[Creating an Array]], so that this page can be a step nearer redirecting without losing codes related to arrays (at least, for Fortran and Smalltalk). --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 13:09, 27 April 2009 (UTC)
::::Does anyone else see anything that needs to be saved from this page? It can be deleted as long as no one wants to save anything. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 05:44, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
:::::At least ADA and AWK seem to have some more information here. And maybe Common Lisp, D etc. Maybe all the languages should be checked. --[[User:PauliKL|PauliKL]] 08:04, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
:The task description of [[Creating an Array]] should be updated to include array initialization. In addition, the task description there says "numeric arrays", while here other types such as strings are discussed, too. --[[User:PauliKL|PauliKL]] 08:04, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
:: By "numeric array", they simply meant the standard type of array that uses a numeric index (as opposed to so-called "associative array" which is actually a map having a potentially more complex key). I'd be happy deleting that "numeric array" red link. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 15:15, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
:::Maybe it should be "numerically-indexed array", as it was called in the talk page. --[[User:PauliKL|PauliKL]] 15:22, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
