I don't know why this was moved to a category. Meh.

I hope someone who's used a recent version can update the info here; the version I use is from 2004... -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 00:45, 12 January 2011 (UTC)
:It got moved to a category because it was used as a language ([[100_doors#REALbasic|exhibit A]]). What do you think it should be? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 02:06, 12 January 2011 (UTC)
::I wasn't thinking of it along those lines. Shrug. Going by that criteria, then yes, definitely category. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 02:30, 12 January 2011 (UTC)

== "Xojo" ==

Well... Xojo. Anyone want to take the time to change every little thing RB-related to Xojo? Sigh. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] ([[User talk:Eriksiers|talk]]) 03:24, 29 June 2013 (UTC)
: Or just create Xojo that redirects to here? [[User:Nerfer|Nerfer]] ([[User talk:Nerfer|talk]]) 00:41, 17 October 2014 (UTC)
::Since the product ''and language'' are now called Xojo by the developers, I guess it should be the other way around: move REALbasic to Xojo, with appropriate redirects. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] ([[User talk:Eriksiers|talk]]) 04:00, 17 October 2014 (UTC)
