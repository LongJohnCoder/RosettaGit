==Do we need this task when we have [[Execute a system command]]?==
Do we? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 07:39, 11 April 2014 (UTC)

:IMHO it makes more sense to add storing the output as an option/extra credit to [[Execute a system command]]. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 10:43, 11 April 2014 (UTC)

::That might have been better had we thought of it when "Execute a system command" was still a draft task but it has over a hundred entries making any task update unfair to the existing entries.
:::That's why I've suggested to add it as an option/extra credit so that just showing how to execute a system command would still be correct :-) I've just skimmed through all the solutions there and at least 35 languages (about a third) already show how to capture the output. (I'm probably misunderstanding the word "unfair" but I don't see RC as a language bragging contest, i.e. "my language is more capable as yours". I'm pretty sure that people will gradually add solutions for the extra credit.). --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 17:42, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
::I think the choice should be "do we delete this as being too similar or not". --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 10:58, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
:::I think showing how to capture the output of a system command is useful. Thus an alternative would be to rename it to something like "Execute a system command/Capture output", i.e. make it a subtask. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 17:42, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
