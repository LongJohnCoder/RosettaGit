== Handy hints ==

Handy optimization hints: Terms in position n that is a prime number are '''always''' the nth prime raised to the (n-1)th power. E.G.

      # 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11
 primes 2  3  5  7 11 13 17 19 23  29  31

    Term 7  is 17^6  == 24137569. 
    Term 11 is 31^10 == 819628286980801.

and so on. 

Non prime odd terms are '''always''' a square number. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 18:53, 11 April 2019 (UTC)

:: You are 100% correct, but these were meant to be optimization hints, not statements of general fact. Sort of an either / or kind of thing. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 09:59, 12 April 2019 (UTC)

: That is one <strike>hel</strike> heck of some dandy hints!!     -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 18:56, 11 April 2019 (UTC)
