This is a duplicate of [[:Category:BASIC_Commodore_PET|BASIC_Commodore_PET]]. The grammer of BASIC Commodore PET suggests that it's the basic of Commodore 64 aka PET BASIC 2.0. Likely there were other Basic variants in VC20/CR16/C128 machines, but this language is not descriptive enough then. I added a redirect to PET Basic. More likely this page needs to be deleted.
