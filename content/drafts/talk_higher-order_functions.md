The PHP example doesn't seem to solve the task in topic (a function should be passed, not an array). Am I correct? Is there something I'm missing? (Some identity between arrays and functions in PHP, maybe, thought I doubt it.)
 
I moved the page, so to avoid misunderstanding of the topic.

:Mostly, I think this is not possible using PHP. I've been using PHP for quite a long time, and I really don't see how this could be done. Nor the use for it. --[[User:CrashandDie|CrashandDie]] 12:58, 25 January 2007 (EST)
::How does PHP handle sorting?  I can't imagine a language that doesn't support higher-order functions (or an Equals interface).  --[[User:Lhignight|Larry Hignight]] 22:02, 19 September 2012 (UTC)

Can anyone clarify '''ANSI C++''' ? No wonder there's no link to such a thing, as for all I remember, '''ANSI C++''' is the same [[C++]] as the one we have an article for. I'm changing the link, but if I'm mistaken and there is such a thing as ANSI C++ that needs another article, be my guest, change it over. --[[User:CrashandDie|CrashandDie]] 12:58, 25 January 2007 (EST)

:Ehm, I'm not sure to fully understand your point, but I'll try to answer. Briefly put, "C++" is the language while "ANSI C++" (or ISO/IEC C++) is the standard definition of that language (well, they're two in fact: ISO/IEC 14882:1998 and ISO/IEC 14882:2003, which are commonly referred as ANSI C++ 1998 and ANSI C++ 2003, the point being that the ANSI C++ Committee and the ISO C++ Committee usually work together and so the documents are more or less the same for the two organizations). Also for the C language there are two articles here around: http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/C and http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/ANSI_C. The first is about the characteristics of the language, the latter is about standardization, and it isn't specific to the version/year, nor the examples I've seen here around are usually too specific about the version of ANSI C (two again: C80/C89 and C99). I was trying to be consistent with that. 
:That said, I'm not sure at all that "ANSI C++" ''needs'' another separated article, the two could be merged just as "C" and "ANSI C" could. I suggest to be consistent, though.
