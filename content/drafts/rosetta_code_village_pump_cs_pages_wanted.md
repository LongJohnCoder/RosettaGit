{{Vptopic
|topic=CS Pages Wanted
|summary=Requesting tasks relating to CS problems.
}}
There was a discussion in the IRC channel a while back where Short Circuit noted that a lot of RC traffic comes from corresponding wikipedia articles. He has asked me to come up with a list of algorithms for which we want tasks. We would want a solid explanation and a starting implementation for these tasks. I have collected a bunch of algorithms from [[wp:List of algorithms|this list]] that probably belong here (any item from that list is probably good to have though):
*Sorting algorithms
:*[[Gnome sort]]
::: I've used Gnome sort in [[Huffman codes]], to sort the heap! Nonetheless I'm little scared by words like "we would want a solid explanation" and "Anyone with a good (and/or recent) CS background..." to be able to start a new task with Gnome sort (my explanation would have been the one in Wikipedia!) --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 23:40, 26 April 2009 (UTC)
:::: I wouldn't let that stop you; At worst, someone will correct the page, and it will come out better for it. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 06:23, 27 April 2009 (UTC)
:*[[Counting sort]]
*Computational geometry
:* [[Closest pair problem]]: find the pair of points (from a set of points) with the smallest distance between them
:*Point in polygon algorithms: tests whether a given point lies within a given polygon
::*[[Point in polygon (ray casting algorithm)|Point in polygon using the ray casting algorithm]]
*Computer algebra
:*[[Polynomial long division]]
*Number theoretic algorithms
:*Integer factorization: breaking an integer into its prime factors (I haven't checked into any of these algorithms. Make sure they're appropriate.)
::: &mdash; see [[Prime decomposition]]; which algo is in use there? --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 09:39, 26 June 2009 (UTC)
::* Congruence of squares
::* Dixon's algorithm
::* Fermat's factorization method
::* General number field sieve
::* Lenstra elliptic curve factorization
::* Pollard's p âˆ’ 1 algorithm
::* Pollard's rho algorithm
::* [[Prime decomposition|prime factorization algorithm]]
::* Quadratic sieve
::* Special number field sieve
*Numerical algorithms
:* Nth roots
::*[[Nth root algorithm]]
::*Shifitng nth root algorithm
:*Interpolation (linear and cubic are probably enough)
:*Eigen value calculation
*Kinda cool
:*XOR swap algorithm
Anyone with a good (and/or recent) CS background is encouraged to jump on these tasks. Link to them as you create them. Try to give an initial implementation to help solidify the task description. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 21:09, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
