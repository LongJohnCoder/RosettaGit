==Tone of 申 ==

Marked here as second tone (rising). Is that right ? I thought it was first tone (flat) shēn. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 14:16, 28 January 2017 (UTC)

:: My knowledge of Chinese pronunciation is somewhere between pitiful and non-existant but I think you may be correct. Contrast https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sh%C3%A9n with https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sh%C4%93n, specifically line #25. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 14:46, 28 January 2017 (UTC)

:: Also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_Branches lists it as shēn. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 14:52, 28 January 2017 (UTC)

::: Yup, typo on my part. Thanks for the correction! --[[User:Markjreed|Markjreed]] ([[User talk:Markjreed|talk]]) 18:46, 28 January 2017 (UTC)
