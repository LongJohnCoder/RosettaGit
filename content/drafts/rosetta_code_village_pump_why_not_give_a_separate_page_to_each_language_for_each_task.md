Why don't give a separate page for each implementation for each task?
Then you can discuss each implementation separately, watch only implementations in your favorite languages ignoring the others, include all implementations for a given language on one page. --Alexei Kopylov 16:03, 10 November 2017 (UTC)}}

:I don't think there's anything "official" about "one giant page of everything" versus "ten million tiny pages". It's just always been this way, although RC was much "smaller" back in them thar days.
:I think that most of the solutions have not been split off from the task pages because it adds an extra step to the whole process, whether looking for a solution, or adding a new one: rather than just ''task page -> scroll to desired language'', it would be ''task page -> scroll to desired language -> follow link to solution''.
:On the other hand, when comparing between languages, it's not unheard of (for me, anyway) to have 2 copies of the page open: one copy showing a language I know, the other copy showing the language I want.
:(There ''are'' some tasks here with implementations split off to their own pages, but those are few and far between. The only example that comes immediately to mind is [[Knapsack Problem/Visual Basic]], which is split off of [[Knapsack problem/Unbounded]], but I know there's more.)
:Just my opinion on the matter. You're always welcome to do as you wish, but don't be surprised if someone else comes along and makes changes you weren't expecting. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] ([[User talk:Eriksiers|talk]]) 03:34, 22 May 2018 (UTC)

::RC has always focused on language *comparison* within what is easily do-able in the wiki used. Normally if one language has a particularly long  example, (how many lines is long?), then the editor might be encouraged to put that languages example on a sub-page of the task and enter a link and short explanation in the main page of the task, but this is a very low frequency exception.

::Tasks are normally written to not take too much code in most languages as we expect people to understand the task and furnish examples in not too much time for them. [[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 14:38, 22 May 2018 (UTC)
