{{feature|Typing/Compatibility}}
In this typing scheme, two types are the same when they have the same structure (e.g., a tuple of a 32-bit integer, a string and a double-precision float is the same as any other tuple of 32-bit integer, string and double); there is no individual identity for type instances.
