{{library}}'''Simple DirectMedia Layer'''

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-[[platform]] multimedia [[libraries|library]] designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via [[OpenGL]], and 2D video framebuffer. It is used by MPEG playback software, emulators, and many popular games, including the award winning [[Linux]] port of "Civilization: Call To Power."

SDL supports Linux, [[Windows]], [[WinCE|Windows CE]], [[BeOS]], MacOS, [[Mac OS X]], FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, [[BSD]]/OS, [[Solaris]], IRIX, and QNX. The code contains support for AmigaOS, Dreamcast, Atari, AIX, OSF/Tru64, RISC OS, SymbianOS, and OS/2, but these are not officially supported.

SDL is written in [[C]], but works with [[C++]] natively, and has bindings to several other languages, including [[Ada]], [[C#]], [[D]], [[Eiffel]], [[Erlang]], Euphoria, [[Haskell]], [[Java]], [[Lisp]], [[Lua]], ML, [[Objeck]], [[Objective C]], [[Pascal]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Pike]], Pliant, [[Python]], [[Ruby]], [[Scheme]] , and [[Smalltalk]].

SDL is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2. This license allows you to use SDL freely in commercial programs as long as you link with the dynamic library.
