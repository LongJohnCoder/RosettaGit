Perhaps a pity that this task looks a bit neglected and incompletely defined ?

I wonder if it would be worth fleshing it out, and perhaps aiming for two complementary representations of N steps of the elaboration of the ternary Cantor set – perhaps for example:
# Each line as a list of intervals, expressed as fractions, and
# some graphic representation of the same


e.g. where N = 4, perhaps something like the following ?


```txt
[0, 1]
[0, 1/3] [2/3, 1]
[0, 1/9] [2/9, 1/3] [2/3, 7/9] [8/9, 1]
[0, 1/27] [2/27, 1/9] [2/9, 7/27] [8/27, 1/3] [2/3, 19/27] [20/27, 7/9] [8/9, 25/27] [26/27, 1]
