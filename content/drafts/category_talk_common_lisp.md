==Categorization in Language Template is Inaccurate==
I've marked CL as going to machine code normally (after all, that's what the Wikipedia article claims once you sort through the confusion) though I accept that this is inaccurate for a language of CL's subtlety in this area. â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:37, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

==ECL==
[[ECL]] links to a different language, so I used a red link [[ECL (Lisp)]] at [[Read a file character by character/UTF8#Common Lisp]] to say that it works with ECL. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] ([[User talk:Kernigh|talk]]) 01:47, 11 June 2014 (UTC)

== How can I run a LISP program? ==

How can I run a LISP program that refers to a function definition, i.e., where should I store this definition so that (fun 1 2 3) finds it? --[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 08:02, 25 May 2016 (UTC)
