The following "paradigms" only seem to be used by this language. Is this really the case? 
;Prototype-oriented
:Would [[Self]] be another example of this?
;Tabular
:I don't know any general language that uses this.
;Message-oriented
:Who's doing this?
Can we identify other languages that are examples of these paradigms? If so, can we fill out these paradigms so that they live correctly within the paradigm description system? (Red links are bad!) â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:21, 7 December 2009 (UTC)
: I'd poke at the [[:Category:Falcon User|users]] who know a thing or two about the language and ask them to fill them in.  Barring that, try reaching the core community for that language.

: At this point, I don't want to drop language descriptives just because they're only used by one language. That strikes me as too close to the spirit of Wikipedia's "original research" and "notability" policies. Their "original research" policy is a poor match for RC, and their "notability" tends to discard non-popular research efforts.

: Another example of a message-oriented language might be [[Objective C]]. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 17:47, 7 December 2009 (UTC)
