These programs were copied here from the Wikipedia article on the Collatz conjecture, where they were less on-topic and some felt they should be removed. See [[wp:Talk:Collatz conjecture#Removal of program languages]]. —[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 19:16, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

:I had intended to do a task on this soon but you beat me to it. I have still gone ahead with [[Hailstone sequence]] though as it is more of a 'proper' task. What do you think. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 00:09, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

::Please go ahead with whatever you think is best, even including replacing this with a redirect and merging the programs. I don't have the time/enthusiasm to review this myself now. —[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 14:40, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

== Retire this task? ==
Should this task be removed in favour of [[Hailstone sequence]] which I have tried to make a better Rosetta Code task,(and which might still serve as a useful link from the wikipedia [[wp:Collatz conjecture|article]])? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 13:44, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

Note that in addition to the Hailstone page, we also seem to have [[Hofstadter-Conway $10,000 sequence]]. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 15:35, 10 June 2010 (UTC)
: Aargh!!! I seem to have started both of these last two?!?!!? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 16:24, 10 June 2010 (UTC)

::: Nice! I commented there that entrants might like to read the respective talk pages too. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 06:08, 11 June 2010 (UTC)


What is the official way to retire this page? Is it possible to:
#  Post a big, dated, notice at the head of the page stating that the page will disappear or something.
#  Stop the page from being further edited. (Except maybe the talk page)?

: I'd suggest copying the existing examples from Collatz to Hailstone, with the Collatz examples marked with [[Template:Needs-review]], then change Collatz to a redirect. Probably only take a few minutes.
: The WP page could be edited to reflect the change, so that WP users aren't bounced around needlessly. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 08:18, 3 April 2010 (UTC)
: We have a [[Template:DeprecatedTask|template for marking deprecated tasks]], but this page, curiously enough, never left draft stage. I'm very averse to applying protection to pages, because of the implications that brings in differing privilege levels, requiring a designee or three for handling such requests, and rules for fair arbitration of disputes. So I'd say leave it unprotected; as a draft or deprecated, it doesn't get attention drawn to it, and if people want to spend time adding to it, that's their choice. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 16:30, 3 April 2010 (UTC)


### Delete and move

My suggestion is to

# Delete all languages from [[Collatz conjecture]] that have solutions at [[Hailstone sequence]].
# Move all the remaining solutions from [[Collatz conjecture]] to [[Hailstone sequence]] and label them <nowiki>{{incomplete}}</nowiki>.
# Redirect [[Collatz conjecture]] to [[Hailstone sequence]].
