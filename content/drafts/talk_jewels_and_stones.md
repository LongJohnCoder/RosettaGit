==task description?==
The task could do with a description on RC. If you don't have permission, please don't just copy another sites description.

Thanks. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 12:27, 25 April 2018 (UTC)

:Indeed. Jewels and Stones is not very descriptive of what the task is doing and could be a copyrighted term. A better, more generic name would be something like: [[Count occurrences of a substring|Count occurrences of a substring. If only we had such a task...]] --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 12:53, 25 April 2018 (UTC)

::Although I didn't create the task, I've added a description which is consistent with the solutions submitted so far. I doubt whether it's a copyrighted term but, if it is, we'll have to change it. --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 13:26, 25 April 2018 (UTC)

::: Sorry. I was trying to be funny but that doesn't come across very well in text. :-( My point was we already have pretty much exactly this task with a more generic name: [[Count occurrences of a substring]] My vote on this task is to merge and delete. (Perhaps with a redirect.)

::It seems to me that there's a subtle difference between the two. The existing task was counting how many times B (of arbitrary length) was contained in A. The new one is counting how many characters (or if you like sub-strings of length 1) ''within'' B are contained in A. 

::I can't say I'm too bothered either way but I'd be inclined to let it stand. What does Paddy think? --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 15:36, 25 April 2018 (UTC)

:::Great description - it is different. As for the title, I googled it and Leetcode and codechef use it, but could not find many more, so one of those sites may have coined it. Could we maybe change the task title to "Jewels ''in'' stones" or "Jewels ''amongst'' stones" maybe? I am not good at this copyright thing.  - --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 21:18, 14 May 2018 (UTC)

::If there's a doubt about copyright, then I agree that it would be best to change the title. "Jewels ''amongst'' stones" sounds good to me.--[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 12:39, 15 May 2018 (UTC)

==what is a letter?==
We've been here before, ...

What is a letter?

English (Roman or Latin)?    Greek?       α ß Γ π Σ σ µ τ Φ Θ Ω δ

Counting   ''characters''   would be easier.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 20:35, 14 May 2018 (UTC)

:Thanks Gerard; I googled and found [https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/55389/what-is-the-difference-between-a-letter-and-a-character this] to help me with the nuances. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 21:28, 14 May 2018 (UTC)

:: Yes, now all we have to do is mention that a Latin/Roman/English alphabet is to be assumed (used) for this Rosetta Code task.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 22:37, 14 May 2018 (UTC)

:::Good idea. I've altered the task description to make it clear that only Latin letters need to be considered which, as far as I can tell, is not inconsistent with any of the existing solutions. --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 12:52, 15 May 2018 (UTC)
