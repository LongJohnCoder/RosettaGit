I believe the technical terms for expression of types "explicit" vs. "implicit" is "manifested typing" vs. "types inference." However, explicit/implicit is IMO more understandable for anyone.
:If it's understandable for anyone, then it should stay that way. If you could keep filling out encyclopedia articles for the terms on this list that'd be great. If anyone would know about them it'd be a guy with a PhD. If any of them get too complicated we can talk about it and try to get a different explanation nailed down. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:53, 17 July 2008 (UTC)
