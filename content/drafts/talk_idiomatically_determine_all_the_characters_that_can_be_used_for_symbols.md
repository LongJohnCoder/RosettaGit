== What do you mean by "symbol"? ==
I have no clue what is meant by "symbol" here.  To a semioticist, every character in the program is a symbol, and every meaningful group of characters is a symbol, and the entire program symbolizes the computation that will be performed when it is invoked.  Most computer languages do not give a technical meaning to the term "symbol" (and those that do define it give differing definitions of it), but it feels as though a particular grammatical or cultural definition is being assumed here without explanation.  RC entries should attempt to transcend cultural differences, not be trapped by them, so we either need to define specifically what is meant by "symbol" as a widely known concept of some sort, or find a less overloaded term that will communicate across differing computing cultures.  Is "symbol" intended to be restricted to what other languages would call "identifiers"?  Does it include operators or other action indicators?  To us linguists, verbs are every bit as symbolic as nouns, and operators are just funny-looking verbs.  On the other hand, if the intent is to use the term "symbol" as a sort of Rorschach blot for us to free associate from and interpret however we like, then that should be made clear too.  It would not be the first RC task to take that approach. <tt>:-)</tt>  --[[User:TimToady|TimToady]] ([[User talk:TimToady|talk]]) 17:14, 21 March 2014 (UTC)

: I would've thought you'd get a clue from the first example entered (REXX).   I didn't want to confuse symbols with characters (or a group of characters) within a computer program.   If every character is a symbol, then we could just use the word ''character''.   As I meant/used/inferred it, symbols can be names of something, mostly used for names of programs/functions/subroutines/routines (another name would be entry points, specifically, the names of entry points), variable names (or structures), names (maybe called ''labels'' or ''events'') of things that can be signaled/invoked (or trapped), etc.   More generally, names that computer programmers can choose, as opposed to names of things that the compiler writers (or the architects) have chosen.   I know that isn't specific enough to please most people, maybe not even some people; but I had to jump in somewhere.   It wasn't my intent to exclude any computer programming languages that didn't have all (or if any) of the classes/types of symbols, nor was it meant to be so defined that some computer programming languages would/might be excluded.   This is the main reason I tried to not define the word specifically so it might become exclusive (or start a definition war).   My background in computer programming is mostly old school (FORTRAN, PL/I, COBOL, BASIC, IBM mainframe assembler, REXX, etc) where symbols have a more traditional (and somewhat confined) usage and/or meaning and usually exclude things like operators, types of statements, and (action) verbs --- and there are others, of course.   I realized before I entered this Rosetta Code task, this would be fraught with the possibility of not adequately defining what a ''symbol'' is, but then, it wouldn't ever have been entered since there wasn't a definition where one-size-fits-all (computer programming languages).   As for defining what a symbol is, and if a computer programming language has other meanings for symbols that can be programmatically determined, then that can be shown/defined in the examples.   We could hash this out forever (trying to define what a symbol is in this context), but I feel there will never be a consensus on any one (specific) definition that would cover all computer programming languages, at least, on one definition that can't be agreed on without a long back and forth discussion.   However, if there is a term for what I envisioned, I'd like to know what it is.   If you could iron one out, give it a try (now that you know what I meant to ask for).   I don't want this to evolve into a detailed discussion on the grammatics of computer science terminology on symbolism or a debate on computer programming cultures. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 18:29, 21 March 2014 (UTC)

: If one computer programming language calls "them" identifiers, others call them names, others call them variables (variable names or names of variables, a miniscule difference), others yet call them labels ...   What is needed is a term that can be understood by everyone what is meant.   Tall order, but of which I have no clear term (or definition). -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 18:39, 21 March 2014 (UTC)

: I've added a general description of ''symbols'' to the task's requirement, I hope it's a start in the right direction (which is much better than reading my mind or viewing/decoding other examples).   The phrase above ''Most computer languages do not give a technical meaning to the term "symbol" (and those that do define it give differing definitions of it), but ···''   was my guideline, knowing full well that my attempt won't fare any better than give some (vague and/or general) description or examples. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 20:42, 21 March 2014 (UTC)

== ooRexx is an Interpreter of Classic Rexx (and MUCH more) ==

A plea to Gerard Schildberger:
Again and again you refuse to accept the fact that ooRexx is an interpreter that can perfectly process "classic" Rexx programs that obey a few (actually very few) restrictions.
I added the modified program and its output to the Rexx section in order to make others aware of the difference. The program was actually also in Category ooRexx as you may have nodiced.
Please reinstate my program instead of unjustly (re)moving it. --[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 19:52, 12 September 2014 (UTC)

::: Of course I refuse (again and again) to accept the (false) fact (see a variant above).   It wouldn't make sense to refuse, refuse, refuse, refuse, and then accept.   I also disagree on what a "few" is, not to mention ''very few'' restrictions.   And even if listed, is the list a "few"?   I looked up the word, and it is:   a small number, one or two, or two or three, hardly any.   Since they weren't listed anywhere, I don't know the number.   You're setting up a straw-man argument here, and I could say the same thing about your beliefs, but that kind of argument is pointless, needless, and sophomoric.   The fact that I consistently refuse to agree (regarding your statement above) with you shouldn't be berated, and this was the first time I've ever seen you use the word "perfectly" in that context, and I have no inkling what you mean by "perfect"   (perhaps "always"?)   That I refuse to accept a falsehood (consistently) or that I refuse (again and again) to accept one of your "facts" shouldn't be ridiculed.   Let's keep this discourse civil, and about keeping ooRexx output(s) in the ooRexx language section.

I don't care what ooRexx does or doesn't do with the REXX program that I entered;   ooRexx has it's own language section and it seems ridiculous to criticize a (Classic) REXX program with the usage of different REXX language (ooRexx).

:::::::: That the ooRexx is the next (or at least one of the next) evolution of Classic REXX, and is one major reason that ooRexx has it's own language section.   One fact is that that first version (of Classic REXX) is executable with any and all Classic REXX interpreters (too many to list here), there are no exceptions that I know of --- nothing needs to be changes/modified for it to run.   This is probably the main reason that the various object-oriented versions of other languages (in Rosetta Code) are in separate language sections, whether or not those o-o language versions could execute those non o-o versions. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 01:46, 17 September 2014 (UTC) 

::::::::: It is another fact (I think) that the second version of this program is executable with any and all Classic REXX interpreters '''AND''' ooRexx (which IS an interpreter for a subset of programs written in '''Classic''' Rexx).

Actually I have documented all the differences I knew on July 2012:

Altogether it may be 10 or a dozen altogether.

Since ooRexx is in the list of implementations shown on the Rexx page there can be

no harm in showing ooRexx output for a Rexx program in this page.

::::::::: I show execution results for some Classic REXX interpreters that are convenient for me to execute (I have other Classic REXX interpreters, but they are a lot of trouble to set up and execute without stepping on my other installed classic REXX interpreters, so I rarely bother with them).   I've entered one Classic REXX program and used (various) Classic REXX interpreters and shown their output.   I've said it before, ooRexx executions belong in the ooRexx language section.   The fact that ooRexx ''may'' execute a Classic REXX program doesn't make ooRexx a Classic REXX interpreter (I know this definition is arguable and is a bone of contention --- but if ooRexx executions would be placed in the ooRexx language section, this would be a moot point).   PL/I ''may'' execute a Classic REXX program, that doesn't make PL/I a REXX interpreter;   nor would anyone expect there be a PL/I entry entered/executed the REXX section to demonstrate that point.   I see no reason to remove the Classic REXX version 1 program entry, there is no redundancy except for the misplaced posting/execution of an ooRexx entry in the Classic REXX language section.   Version 2 (if executed with ooRexx) belongs in the ooRexx language section.   As an aside, if ooRexx executes classic REXX programs, have it execute version 1.

Let's get back to square zero (or rather column 1 here.

I DO understand "tongue in cheek"
(never heard of "tongue in check" :-) and in better times I have corrected your spelling errors
and/or typos).
Adding ooRexx output for version 1 demonstrates clearly the point of this task and the
thousands of lines we spent on "discussing" that matter.

Let's try to get to some common view.

The REXX Language Section is the place to show REXX programs solving a given task.
One may show results with any Rexx interpreter or compiler.
Results from other interpreters can and should be shown where this makes sense.

Not to permit what ooRexx does with a Rexx program is unacceptable.
(showing what PL/I does with such a program does not make sense.)
Ideal REXX programs (my definition) are those that concentrate on the task and give identical results
for all REXXes. Sadly many of the programs you added and still add aren't ideal in this sense. Mine are.--[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 06:21, 14 September 2014 (UTC)

-----

I apologize for the typo of the second mention of "tongue in cheek".   Fortunately, the first use was spelled correctly, so I know you knew what I was referring to.   (I've marked the typo and corrected it).

I have to disagree with your statement about the point of this task.   The '''REXX''' language section if for (Classic) REXX;   ooRexx interpreters (programs and/or output) should be placed in the ooRexx language section.   Just because you can (or may) execute a Classic REXX program with ooRexx doesn't mean that you should enter the ooRexx's output in the (Classic) REXX section to show the difference --- (that's the reason PL/I was mentioned, but you've missed the point).   That's why there's an ooRexx language section; you can show ooRexx's output there.   If people want to know how NetRexx or ooRexx output(s) differ, they merely look in those language sections.   That is one reason why there ''are'' language sections.

As for common views:   stating that they ''are'' common views doesn't make it so.   It should be obvious from these discussions that your statement isn't true.

The REXX language section is for Classic REXX;   NetRexx and ooREXX have their own language sections to show their output(s), and they have their own language sections because of the many differences which differentiate those languages from Classic REXX (whether or not those other languages can execute Classic REXX statements/syntax or not).   The REXX language section isn't a catchall place that you can add any varient or dialect (or ...), especially when ooRexx has it's own section.   Claiming that you can add ooRexx under the Classic REXX section just because it makes sense to you isn't a valid reason, output from ooRexx shouldn't be added willy-nilly to other language sections.   Output from ooRexx should be in the ooRexx language section.

Perhaps to make this point clearer:   There are many ''BASIC'' language sections, yet no one is entering all manner of BASIC programs to other variants (dialects/versions/...) to each other BASIC language sections.   It would just be one ginormous clutter.   Everybody enters their version of a BASIC program into the respective BASIC language section.   ... Regardless that a program could be executed by another BASIC compiler/interpreter.   The same logic is applied here:   ooRexx output goes in the ooRexx language section.   I believe that this talk section header (title) of   ''ooRexx is an interpreter of Classic REXX ...''   is probably the underlying basis of this discussion;   ''ooRexx '''may''' interpret Classic REXX''.   Of course, that doesn't sound as good (and a bit hollow), but there are restrictions to what ooRexx will tolerate, as you've shown ooRexx to do with the (Classic) REXX version 1 of this Rosetta Code task.   This should be obvious of one reason why ooRexx has its own language section.   I've heard the argument that ooRexx handles all Classic REXX (even perfectly!?), and if ooRexx doesn't, then it's not Classic REXX.   An interesting circular definition   (and by the way, I'm not accusing anyone in particular of making such a statement and/or argument).   The discussion then sometimes veers off about the definition (or lack thereof) of what Classic REXX is (or the lack of a clear definition), and statements about ooRexx being a Classic REXX interpreter, and so it goes.  

I haven't in any way restricted what ooRexx does (or places its output) with any type of program when placing anything of ooRexx stuff in the proper section, ooRexx.   ooRexx has it's own language section and you certainly have the right to include any manner of ooRexx output(s) to it's proper place:   ooRexx.   Just because ooRexx   can or may   execute some REXX program shouldn't give you carte blanche to enter ooRexx output to other language section, that is why there is an ooRexx section.   ooRexx output belongs under ooRexx.   This is the crux of my discussion.   That you want to add the output of ooRexx yet to another language section (when ooRexx already has it's own language section) is just duplication and it clutters up the (Classic) REXX language section.   If there are differences (or even if there aren't any), then show that in the ooRexx language section.   You'll never see me enter a Classic REXX output in the ooRexx section just to show the differences.   To me, that would be absurd, and it's strange that it isn't obvious to everyone.   If you can agree to the obvious reason for that, than maybe you can see why ooRexx's output doesn't belong in the (Classic) REXX language section, but rather that ooRexx output(s) belong in the ooRexx section.   That's where I would look to see what/how ooRexx solves a Rosetta Code task.   

If you can't see my point about another language (PL/I for instance) executing the exact same code (as REXX or any language), then you're not looking at the bigger picture.

I don't know why you're introducing yet another definition   ("ideal" programs),   it hasn't been used before, and it appears that you're trying to define a word/phrase to help justify your adding of ooRexx output to the (Classic) REXX language section.   As I read your definition (concerning identical results), well, hell's bells, none of the results (for ONE Classic REXX program) give identical results   (except for those REXX interpreters which were written by the same programmer).   This isn't the place to introduce a loosey-goosey definition to help justify cross-posting another's language program in the wrong language section.   The (Classic) REXX language sections, as well as NetRexx and ooRexx sections) where around for quite some time now, and up to now, we've lived OK without adding another definition or criteria for "ideal" programs.   This isn't an ideal world, and there are enough differences just between the Classic REXX interpreters, yet alone with ooRexx and NetRexx.   ooRexx and NetRexx have their own syntax rules (some common syntax, but there are restrictions, and other extensions/capabilities/features/...), and is one main reason that they each have their own language section.   

I'm really not the least bit interested in your definition of the REXX programs that I've entered, and whether or not they fit your "ideal" description.   I enter Classic REXX programs (and note if they only work for specific implementations); I also prefer not to judge critically of others programs and post the criticism.   It's more polite to just enter one's own version and not be insulting to another's handiwork.   (My car is better looking than your car, and it's faster, and gets better mileage, AND has whitewalls?)   People in glass houses shouldn't ···       Or, do onto others like you'd like to have them do to you.

If you'd just added the ooRexx output to the ooRexx language section, all this verbage wouldn't be necessary.   I understand your agenda of trying to make it seem that ooRexx can execute all Classic REXX programs, but that doesn't belie the fact that ooRexx entries belong in the ooRexx language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 14 September 2014 (UTC)

Whether or not an   ooRexx   program makes sense or not to be in the ooRexx section (category/language/etc) isn't the issue.   The 2nd ooRexx version looked different enough in my eyes (and therefore not the same program), so it was moved to the ooRexx section (but the main reason was that the ooRexx program was an ooRexx program, and ooRexx programs have their own language section).

... And whether or not   ooRexx   has more features and facilities isn't the point either.

The '''REXX''' language (on Rosetta Code) is for '''Classic REXX''', not for '''ooRexx'''   (and as you know, ooRexx has it's own section).

If I find a language (such as Run BASIC) in the BASIC section, I'd probably move that also.   It's not like that I'm ''deleting'' it or somesuch.   Each language has it's own section, and I can understand why someone would mistakenly enter such a program under the wrong BASIC language section. 

And, yes, I refuse to accept the statement (which is not a fact) that the ooRexx is an interpreter that can   ''perfectly''   process Classic Rexx (there's no need to put the word ''classic'' in quotes unless you're referring to some other Classic REXX definition).   (By the way, I use the definition of Classic REXX as defined in an IBM document quite a few years back which was published about the time that oRexx was being talked about, and there needed to be a better definition of what the ''REXX'' language was (as far as syntax, etc) versus the REXX language variant that was being discussed in the oRexx document).   Please don't try to make out that I'm a bad guy for not accepting that statement as a fact (even if I do it again and again).   It isn't a fact, so I shouldn't be put on the carpet that I refuse to accept a (false) fact (even if more than once).   This isn't the place to argue about that statement and I don't want to be part of that myth.   Also, the use of   ''few (actually very few) restrictions''   wording depends on what you mean by few (put a number on it), and better still, list all the differences.   Whatever the list is, it most likely won't be complete, and I have yet to see a comprehensive or itemized list.   It shouldn't be that hard to draw up a list, after all, those differences should be known by the supporters and maintainers of ooRexx.   As ooRexx isn't my dog, I have no interest nor do I have an agenda in compiling that list.   That should be left to the people pushing the idea that ooRexx can perfectly process (or just process) any Classic REXX program.   But the bottom line here is that there are enough differences (not to mention ooRexx's other features, capabilities, and options), which in my mind, make it a different language.   I have never seen that list either (of ooRexx's expanded facilities) that are different from the features offered in any Classic REXX).   But, whether or not I believe any part of such a statement, doesn't negate the fact that ooRexx has it's own language section, and that's where ooRexx programs belong, not in the Classic Rexx language section.

Also, it doesn't matter if ooRexx may execute a Classic REXX program (or not), ooRexx still has its own language section, and it exists for more than one reason (and I'll not go into listing them here --- but the ooRexx language section DOES exist, and it's for ooRexx programs) --- puting ooRexx programs yet into another language section is a waste of space on Rosetta Code and also user's time and effort when trying to find a Classic REXX solution.   I have no agenda trying to push ooRexx (and it's claim that it can run/execute Classic REXX programs).   We've been here before, '''REXX''' is for any Classic REXX interpreter, '''ooRexx''' is for the Object Orientated Rexx interpreter(s).   I won't remove the (2<sup>nd</sup>) ooRexx entry that was moved to the ooRexx section;   if the original author wants to remove it, they can of course.   Let's try to keep the two languages separate and refrain from entering ooRexx programs under the wrong language category.   A while back, someone actually used the (my) Classic REXX program (in its entirety) and executed it ''in toto'' under another (non-REXX) language, and it produced exactly the same output (and it was noted as such in that other language's '''output''' section).   That another language (not any form of REXX) correctly executed the Classic REXX program doesn't give me license to enter that Classic REXX program under another language (section), even though it executes the REXX program perfectly correct (sic).   There is no need to enter an ooRexx program under two language entries (REXX and ooREXX).   Putting another language under the '''REXX''' entry just to show the differences between Classic REXX and ooRexx is not the way to show the differences.   One can just view the output of the ooRexx program (under the ooRexx section) and compare it with the program under the REXX entry to see the differences (that goes for '''NetRexx''' as well).   Adding a duplicate version under the wrong or inappropriate section is contrary to the philosophy at Rosetta Code (as I understand it).   I know there is a falsely-held belief that ooRexx will execute Classic REXX programs, but there is enough differences such that ooRexx has its own section, so the claim that ooRexx executes (all/some/many) Classic REXX programs is a mute point.   I do understand that ooRexx ''' ''may'' ''' correctly execute some Classic REXX programs.   But there are enough differences in the two languages that having ooRexx programs under the Classic REXX language section would just clutter up the entries in the REXX section;   why make it more difficult for people who want to just look at Classic REXX programs and not have to wade through ooRexx programs as well?   Putting ooRexx programs under the Classic REXX language section will also make it a royal pain in the neckhole if a person wanted to find an ooRexx program for a Rosetta Code task, and they had to look in   two   places, ooRexx and also (Classic) REXX.   There are enough versions of Classic REXX programs as it is.   That is one reason why ooRexx has its own language section, but certainly not the only reason).   Furthermore, I certainly don't want to go through 700 different Classic REXX entries and label each of them as being Classic REXX and which Classic REXX interpreter that was used to test the program which produced the output (not the least of which are the mis-entered ooRexx programs in the Classic REXX section) --- it's always easy to suggest that somebody else do the work.   So, that would be another reason to keep and have ooRexx entries in the ooRexx language section.   Classic REXX programs in the REXX language section, ooRexx programs in the ooRexx language section, NetRexx programs in the NetRexx language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 00:48, 13 September 2014 (UTC)

: I still have to carefully read your essay, bur let me ask a few questions:

:: Well, reading carefully is always a good thing to do (but I question what a ''few'' means).   I choose to respond to your numerous questions point by point instead of lumping all the responses at the end. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)



Is section REXX to contain REXX programs or implementations?

: The REXX language section is for Classic REXX.   ooRexx isn't a Classic REXX interpreter   (I know, I know, saying that to some people is cause for fisticuffs).   However, having said that, ooRexx   ''may''   execute a Classic REXX program, but that isn't the issue.   ooRexx programs should be entered in the ooRexx language section.   The fact that ooRexx may execute a (Classic) REXX program doesn't negate the fact that ooRexx has it's own Rosetta Code language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


WHY do you mention NetRexx in your essay? Just to make it longer??

: No, NetRexx is ''a'' REXX (or a REXX variant or something else, depending on which people you ask).   But the question is moot, as there is a Rosetta Code language section for NetRexx, and that's where all the NetRexx programs have been entered.   NetRexx program entries have never been added in the REXX language entry (... that I know of, it's possible that was done sometime in the past).   The 2nd snide question isn't worth responding to.   Try to remain civil here at Rosetta Code.   It's a slippery slope. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)  


Can all REXX implementations that you use run my version successfully?

: Again, that isn't the issue.   What matters is that you entered and executed an ooRexx program with ooRexx in the (Classic) REXX language section.   That's what the ooRexx language section is for.   Enter ooRexx programs in the ooRexx language section.   I have quite a few different Classic REXX interpreters, not all of which are easy to use with other REXXes being installed; not all REXX implementations play well together (er, ... that is, they can't be implemented without stepping on each other's toes, and for another thing, they all seem to want to be named REXX if only in part, ... go figure). -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


Aren't my variable names more intuitive than yours?

: Again, that isn't the question.   This isn't a contest, Walter, of which program has the more intuitive variable names.   Using intuitive variable names is a very subjective ... more black art than anything else.   Not that this is germane, but I often see that when people talk about intuitive variable names, they are usually too long and fill up the program code space and programmers often use those names in lieu of comments or documentation.   I believe there is no substitution for comments, but them's fighting words and I certainly don't want to start a debate on that topic.   Again, ooRexx programs should be entered in the ooRexx language section.   This shouldn't be about egos about who has the prettiest names, more intuitive names, better structure, better and/or consistent indentations, more comments, more whitespace, aligned comments (or not), better this, better that ... yada, yada, yada. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


What's wrong when I show what a particular implementation does with a program?

: ooRexx should be entered in the ooRexx language section.   That is the venue for ooRexx.   If you want to show what an ooRexx program does, enter it in the proper language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


Does REXX have a changestr BIF?

: It depends what REXX implementation (and/or which REXX language definition) you're referring to:   TRL1, TRL2, ANSI REXX standard, what the IBM (CMS and/or TSO gold standard) does, etc.   Or you could change the question slightly and ask which REXX interpreter does or doesn't have the '''changestr''' bif.   This would be a good subject when discussing different (levels or implementations) of various REXX interpreters, but that would be a lengthy topic (or essay), but I'm not sure that information would be appropriate or valuable on Rosetta Code.   But I certainly wouldn't stop anyone from attempting it.   Collecting all that information from the numerous Classic REXX implementations would be daunting and time consuming.   I wonder how many AREXX and/or OS/2 users are out there. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)

:: As an aside, if Rosetta Code ever changes it ways and somehow lets me add new pages and/or links without that painful Captcha verification "system", I'll rename all the entries that don't seem to fit the Rosetta Code naming convention (including the '''changestr''' REXX subroutine).   As it is (and I've mentioned it elsewhere on various Rosetta Code locations), and for whatever reason, I (and others) have a painful (and time consuming) time getting the information to be displayed correctly (or in my case, not displayed at all).   What I have to do is wait for some amount of time, usually forcing me to shutdown all other windows (ugh), and then request an audible prompt, then ignore the gawd-awful sounds (more noise than anything), and then request a typed prompt.   "Replay" doesn't work.   This jig has to be repeated a number of times.   Now THAT is something to sigh about.   It usually takes me anywhere from a ¼ hour to an ½ hour, sometimes more if there are other updates being done to the same page.   This is the main reason that I've stopped entering Rosetta Code (draft) tasks.   And don't get me started on adding/changing/correcting a link.   Sheesh. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:43, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


Why do you ever so often say "some REXXes~ don't contain... CHANGESTR," for example?

: Simply because at least four of REXX interpreters that I know of '''do not''' have the '''changestr''' bif, so I mention it and point to a version that does work for all (Classic) REXX interpreters.   By the way, if you know of a REXX entry (of mine) that uses '''changestr''' and doesn't have a mention of the link to the '''changestr''' subroutine, please give me a shout on my user talk page, and I'll fix that. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


Where did I ask you to rewrite your programs to please ooRexx (and me)?

: I don't understand your question.   When did I stop beating my wife? -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


WHAT's WRONG with my statement "ooRexx is an interpreter that can perfectly process "classic" Rexx programs that obey a few (actually very few) restrictions."?

: I don't know what you mean by ''perfectly process'', but I am assuming that it means to process (execute?) without failure (as in being upward compatible).   I also don't know what you mean by "few", or actually, ''very few'' restrictions.   Put a number to the word ''few'', and a list would be better.   Whether or not ooRexx can or can't execute a (Classic) REXX program, ooRexx programs should be entered in the ooRexx language section.   What is the ooRexx language section for?   Are ooRexx programs to be entered then in two different language sections?   That situation would beg duplication (or redundancy). -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


Why do you delete other person's programs?

: Please be specific.   Which programs (and where) did I delete other person's programs?   Are you talking about REXX programs, or are you just shooting a shotgun here?   This is one reason why almost everybody doesn't sign their signatures to a program, the entries belong to Rosetta Code (as I understand the statements at the bottom of every screen page when editing is being performed), and I hope I'm using the correct phraseology.   Maybe esteemed others could add a few words here about program entry ownership (or lack of it). -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


Why do YOU add a REDUNDANT program to the ooRexx section?

: If you're referring to the different version of an ooRexx program that was entered in the (Classic) REXX language section that was then '''moved''' to the ooRexx language section, it looked different to me, it executed with different statements, and had different output.   If it was (or is) redundant, then it shouldn't have been entered at all.   And if you think the ooRexx program is redundant, then remove it. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)


SIGH --[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 05:58, 13 September 2014 (UTC)

: I share your sighing.   This too is getting old for me, all that is being discussed here (essay or not) is a rehash of ooRexx and (Classic) REXX differences (or execution of same depending on some number of unnamed restrictions, at least, not named here on Rosetta Code).   There shouldn't be this amount of snipping or snide questions.   If you need to classify what I write as an essay, that's OK, essays should be wrote carefully and be read carefully, and I try to choose my words carefully and I'm trying to informal as well while being accurate.   It's not my intent to quantify the differences.   My only point (and I've said it a few times, please enter ooRexx programs in the ooRexx language section.   It's a simple application of the golden rule.   How would anyone feel if I would enter "correct/working" (Classic) REXX entries in the ooRexx language section?   Keeping ooRexx programs in the proper language section makes all these issues go away.   I've written what I meant to say as clear as I can.   If you would enter ooRexx programs in the ooRexx language section, there wouldn't be a need to discuss at length the differences between ooRexx and (Classic) REXX programs and/or interpreters and/or implementations.   Another bad thing about entering an ooRexx entry in the (Classic) REXX language section is, how can anyone else find out which Rosetta Code tasks '''don't''' have a (Classic) REXX entered?   When perusing the   ''tasks not solved for REXX''   would have an entry (well, it would be an ooRexx entry).   They would have to look at every Rosetta Code task (and drafts) to find out which (Classic) REXX entries are actually ooRexx entries, and not (Classic) REXX entries.   That defeats the purpose of having a list of unsolved Rosetta Code tasks (or unsolved draft tasks). -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 08:23, 13 September 2014 (UTC)

: Here's my '''48 words''':
Is it ok to add programs written in Rexx and the results when executing them with ooRexx in the REXX section as long as they don't use features existant only in ooRexx and thus yield exactly the same result when run with other REXXes (or deviations where applicable)?
--[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 09:24, 17 September 2014 (UTC)

: I don't know how to ask people for a vote (there were only two involved in this discussion) but here is a list of twelve statements that I consider to be TRUE and invite anybopy's contradiction. The very long discussion at hand is addressed in statement 7 below.

1. You never complained when I added a Rexx program in the REXX section (new or alternate version).

2. You complained when I (once) used there a feature not supported in '''Classic''' Rexx (thanks).

3. Modifying all current REXX programs to be accepted by ooRexx would be a huge effort (changing AND testing).

4. Entering the modified versions in the ooRexx section would make ooRexx' rank larger than Rexx' but introduce lots of redundancy.

5. '''Classic''' Rexx means different things to different people (I know of at least two).

6. Ideally all interpreters give the same result for a program (apart from the interpreter's or compiler's version, of course).

7. Adding output for a program from several interpreters makes sense when they differ (e.g., the RANDOM and JUSTIFY bifs of REXX).

8. Rexx programs using features added by ooRexx are entered in the ooRexx section possibly stating the minimum version to be used.

9. Two implementations of a language are compatible if each possible program yields the same result when run on both.

10. Implementation B is upward compatible with A when every program that executes successfully on A runs on B yielding the same result

11. ooRexx is not fully upward compatible with Classic Rexx but to a large extent.

12. Programs that obey a list of restrictions (by not using features no longer existant in ooRexx) yield identical results for both.

(I apologize ahead of time to the Rosetta Code admins and others for duplicating the above statements and breaking them up below in order to address the points.)

Since you listed so many "true" statements of yours that I thought I'd address them point-by point here.   I really wish you hadn't entered this long list of "true" statements here on Rosetta Code which I feel then have to be addressed, not withstanding your invite.   This almost endless listing of truisms is very subjective.   My singular opinion concerning all of this is:   Enter '''ooRexx''' output in the ooRexx language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


1. You never complained when I added a Rexx program in the REXX section (new or alternate version).

:::: Nor why should ''anyone'' complain?   I did not do a lot of things.   <nowiki> <humor> Shame on you Paddy, you didn't complain either. </humor> </nowiki> -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC) 


2. You complained when I (once) used there a feature not supported in '''Classic''' Rexx (thanks).

:::: Yes, I pointed out some syntax errors in the (Classic) REXX entry that wasn't appropriate for the REXX section.   I wouldn't characterize it as a complaint. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


3. Modifying all current REXX programs to be accepted by ooRexx would be a huge effort (changing AND testing).

:::: The REXX section is for Classic REXX.   It would be silly and a gihugeic waste of time to modify all those programs just to make them suitable for another language, not the least of which is that I don't even have an ooRexx interpreter installed.   To even suggest that the programs be modified for another language (and then tested) borders on folly.   Since ooRexx has it's own language section, it wouldn't matter that much what the definition of a Classic REXX interpreter is if output from ooRexx would be in the ooRexx language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


4. Entering the modified versions in the ooRexx section would make ooRexx' rank larger than Rexx' but introduce lots of redundancy.

:::: There is no need (my weak opinion) to modify Classic REXX programs and then enter them in the ooRexx language section, that wouldn't show anything different from the original algorithm, but I certainly don't want to hinder or deter anyone from adding a <nowiki> {{trans REXX}} </nowiki> and doing the testing when using ooRexx (in its own language section).   I don't understand your concern about rankings, why is that even an issue? -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


5. '''Classic''' Rexx means different things to different people (I know of at least two).

:::: Yes, this is one thing I agree with, but I disagree with the number;   I believe it to be many.   The meaning of what Classic REXX is (and what a Classic REXX interpreter is as well) causes much debate and discussion, that is the major reason that ooRexx has its own language section --- then the subject is mainly moot and needn't be addressed and discussed endlessly (seemingly) on Rosetta Code. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


6. Ideally all interpreters give the same result for a program (apart from the interpreter's or compiler's version, of course).

:::: There are other differences (whether or not it's a bug is based on some variations of definitions).   I've found a whole ****load (wheelbarrow, I meant to say) of differences between Classic REXX interpreters, most fixed as bugs, others dismissed as working as designed (WAD, ... sigh) --- essentially, you believe what you want, we believe what we want.   One problem is which Classic REXX standard is being used (or adhered to).   I normally roll back to what I consider as the "gold standard", the IBM CMS implementation of (Classic) REXX, nobody can argue that that version isn't a Classic REXX as that's where it was invented and is maintained as such to this day.   Not all interpreters belong in the Classic REXX section, ooRexx belongs in the ooRexx language section, NetRexx belongs in the NetRexx language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


7. Adding output for a program from several interpreters makes sense when they differ (e.g., the RANDOM and JUSTIFY bifs of REXX).

:::: '''ooRexx''' output belongs in the ooRexx language section, not the (Classic) '''REXX''' section.   Adding output from object-oriented languages in the wrong language section (i.e., not the "base" language) shouldn't be allowed, it just clutters up the "base" language with an o-o version, whether or not that example uses o-o constructs or features.   If people want to see what ooRexx has for output, look in the ooRexx section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC) 


8. Rexx programs using features added by ooRexx are entered in the ooRexx section possibly stating the minimum version to be used.

:::: I go further than that.   ooRexx entries are to be entered in the ooRexx section, no matter what features are used (or not used).   Furthermore, no matter which program is used, when using the ooRexx interpreter, enter those results in the ooRexx language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


9. Two implementations of a language are compatible if each possible program yields the same result when run on both.

:::: Er, no.   Two languages aren't compatible just because they both "execute" identical programs:   '''K=1'''   (as a simple example) will probably be executed identically on all manner of programs, not just REXX.   Two languages are compatible if they have compatible features (or equal, if you will).   ooRexx has quite a number of features/options/extensions that aren't compatible or supported by the Classic REXX interpreters, and, of course, vice versa.   I believe that since ooRexx can't interpret all Classic REXX statements, it's not a Classic REXX interpreter.   I know it can execute ''most'' statements, but like chimps, we share 98% of DNA.   Close, but no cigar. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


10. Implementation B is upward compatible with A when every program that executes successfully on A runs on B yielding the same result

:::: I don't quite understand this statement.   So the case of       <big>'''upper @'''</big>       (which isn't compatible with ooRexx) means that ooRexx isn't upward compatible with the other?   I may be getting the wrong idea about your statement.   That would make ooRexx not compatible with any Classic REXX. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


11. ooRexx is not fully upward compatible with Classic Rexx but to a large extent.

:::: Even '''if''' ooRexx was fully upward compatible with Classic REXX, ooRexx still has it's own language section.   People go to the Classic REXX section to look and/or use copies of that REXX code to use with their Classic REXX interpreters.   They go to the ooRexx language section to see ooRexx output (or programs). -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)


12. Programs that obey a list of restrictions (by not using features no longer existant in ooRexx) yield identical results for both.

:::: That would depend on the list of restrictions (is it complete?) --- I say it isn't, as witnessed by a long discussion on this very topic in some older postings of the '''comp.lang.rexx''' newsgroup.   It is not my dog, I don't want nor feel to need to list all the differences, I don't care what they are as I deal with only Classic REXX and that is my only concern and focus.   Whether or not whatever differences/enhancements/additions/incompatibilities exists in ooRexx, is one major reason that ooRexx has it's own language section.   I see no reason whatsoever why Classic REXX programs (REXX entries on Rosetta Code) need to conform (or be changed) to another language's (ooRexx) restrictions or idiosyncrasies.   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:30, 17 September 2014 (UTC)

Since I have to resort to a very short (50 words) synopsis of what I believe about entering Classic REXX programs on Rosetta Code   (without having to define what Classic REXX or other terms are):

::: '''REXX''' is for Classic REXX interpreters.

::: '''ooRexx''' is for ooRexx regardless that it does (or doesn't) use ooRexx syntax or features.

::: Programmers can peruse ooRexx to observe ooRexx differences.

::: The fact that ooRexx ''may'' execute Classic REXX programs doesn't deter that:   output from ooRexx should be in the ooRexx section.

P.S.:   By the way, I'm not asking anyone to vote on this issue, I believe it should be decided (once and for all) by some (or all) Rosetta Code administrators). -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:34, 17 September 2014 (UTC)

:: As for me I do ask for votes and I would be extremely surprised if they would disallow to add programs to the REXX Language section that can be run by all available REXX interpreters, including ooRexx. Is that what you are asking for, or what?--[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 22:38, 17 September 2014 (UTC)

::: No, ... I guess it is the "what".   Please carefully re-read my succinct summary (immediately above the separator line).   I have never stated that ooRexx ''is'' a classic REXX interpreter, so I don't include ooRexx as being one of the Classic REXX interpreters, much as you want it to be.   Although ooRexx ''may'' execute some Classic REXX programs, ooRexx output belongs in the ooRexx language section.   I don't believe I can make it more plainer and clearer than that. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 22:48, 17 September 2014 (UTC)

:::: This is kind of ridiculous (sorry for being harsh). Since we can't really define what Classic REXX is or isn't (different things to some (you say many) people, we cannot define "Classic Rexx Interpreter". ooRexx is an interpreter that interprets a huge subset of all possible REXX programs exactly as many other REXX interpreters.
Subset: those that don't use... read my 48 words '''carefully'''. It is irrelevant whether the list of trouble spots that I listed is complete. One may find more when attempting to run programs with ooRexx. Some people even do! The 3 (three) problems I have with your programs and ooRexx I have enumerated many a time.
To place the ooRexx '''output''' in the ooRexx section without copying the source would be most unreasonable, so would it be to copy programs.
PS: I said '''REXX Interpreters'''.
Differences should be shown where the REXX programs are (in the REXX '''language''' section). The sections are, my understanding, for languages, not interpreters.
--[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 07:30, 18 September 2014 (UTC)

::::: I don't agree that Classic REXX can't be defined.   It's that there wouldn't be (most probably) an '''agreement''' on a definition.   I have tried to define Classic REXX here before, but the disagreements degenerate into what ooRexx does or doesn't do with (all) Classic REXX programs (rather than focusing on what a Classic REXX is), and even ignoring all the new ooRexx features, not the least of which is object-oriented programming and other constructs, ooRexx is a different language.   As long as ooRexx kept to the ooRexx language section, it wasn't a problem; it was a non-issue.   The situation hasn't come up before the latest cross-posting of ooRexx in the Classic REXX section.   It appears that because there is a disagreement about what ooRexx is (claiming it is a Classic REXX interpreter) and how (or if) it can interpret some (but not all) Classic REXX statements is causing a stumbling block in agreeing to a definition of what Classic REXX is.   I get the impression that because there is a belief that ooRexx can interpret some Classic REXX programs, that makes it a Classic REXX interpreter.   It doesn't make it so.   Because of the differences (not to mention all the object-oriented features, syntax, and other options/features that make it a much different language), ooRexx has it's own language section in Rosetta Code, and this essentially nullifies the arguments of what ooRexx does or doesn't do with Classic REXX programs; the solution has been to keep ooRexx concerns/issues/differences/programs/output in the ooRexx language section (which helps keeps a proper focus on ooRexx for those people who are interested in ooRexx and it's concerns).   If ooRexx programs and/or output would be kept in the ooRexx language section, there wouldn't be a need to have this discussion.   For a clarifying example, there isn't a definition of any of the BASIC interpreters, because each BASIC interpreter on Rosetta Code has its own language section, nobody cross-posts different versions or dialects of BASIC in other language sections, so there is no need to have endless discussions on what any particular (version) of BASIC will do with another's (BASIC) language statements.   There is no need to define what each language is or what the capabilities are that are different from other BASIC languages.   The same is true for the various '''C''' languages and its derivatives and evolutionary variants.   (I don't know all the variants of either BASIC or '''C''', but I hope my points are clear).   I don't understand the issue about "trouble spots";   these are some differences between Classic REXX and ooRexx interpreters and point out some of the language differences between the two (but only in one direction, things that ooRexx can't handle or does differently from Classic REXX programs --- and never mentions the things that Classic REXX can't handle with ooRexx features, syntax, and other options).   As long as ooRexx stuff is in the ooRexx language section, there is no need to include a list of what Classic REXX things don't behave as they do in ooRexx.   I have never seen a list on Rosetta Code that tries to differentiate between two other languages ('''C''' and '''D''' for instance? --- there simply isn't a need, they each have their own language section).   I never mentioned nor implied that one should place the output of ooRexx in the ooRexx language section ''without'' copying the source (program).   Where did you ever get such an idea like that, to separate the output from the program across two language sections?   That's another straw-man argument, inferring that I stated something, and then saying that is unreasonable.   When putting ooRexx output in the ooRexx language section, the program would be included along with the output (as it is currently done with all other programs on Rosetta Code).   Furthermore, ooRexx is a separate language (not just a dialect); that should be obvious from the (additional) object-oriented features, syntax, features, and other options not found in any Classic REXX interpreter. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 14:44, 18 September 2014 (UTC)

I defer about ooRexx being more or less different (as well as NetRexx, for that matter, even though a lot of common syntax is shared), it is very different, inclusion of o-o is a big part of that.

== entering ooRexx entries in wrong language section ==

I see an ooRexx language entry was again incorrectly added to the (Classic) REXX language section.   ooRexx has it's own language section; nowhere else is there cross-posting of entries of one language (with it's own language section) into a different language section (there may be exceptions on talk pages, but I don't know that).   If more explanation is needed, the above (preceding) talk section can be reviewed.   Perhaps it would be equitable if modified (for those differences that ooRexx can't handle) Classic REXX entries were also entered under the ooRexx section?   Of course not.   The venue for ooRexx examples is in the ooRexx language section.   Entering an ooRexx entry in the Classic REXX section to show the differences from ooRexx isn't way to do that. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 19:08, 13 September 2014 (UTC)

I don't see any benefit of these editing skirmishes.   It's become a colossal waste of time in trying to explain that ooRexx entries belong in the ooRexx language section, irrespective of what ooRexx can or can't support.   If it is believed that cross-posting of one language into another language section is acceptable and permissible, I won't move it the 3<sup>rd</sup> time.   My time is more valuable then trying to keep ooRexx progams in the ooRexx language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 19:08, 13 September 2014 (UTC)

:: The second entry where '''ooRexx''' was used to show '''ooRexx''' output.   ooRexx has it's own language section:   ooRexx.   Note that I'm not (nor did I ever) state that it wasn't a valid version of a (Classic) REXX program.   What I'm saying that if you use ooRexx to interpret/execute it and produce output, you should place the output (and the program entry) in the ooRexx language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 21:49, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

:::_And this is the point where I disagree and am asking Paddy for his opinion. I fail to see what you mean by '''ooRexx language entry'''. Version 2 is a REXX program and one of the interpreters is used to show the output. I invited you to add the output of others. That would be constructive.

An ooRexx language entry, to me, is one that uses any of the features of ooRexx such as classes, methods, but also some othe nice stuff like x+=1. --[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 23:20, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

:::: An ooRexx (language) entry is any program that one enters and uses with the ooRexx interpreter to produce output   (no matter what features/syntax/options you use or don't use).   The interpreter you choose to execute the program was ooRexx, and coincidentally, ooRexx has it's own language section.   Output from an ooRexx execution should be placed in the ooRexx language section along with it's source.   If it helps resolve this issue, I invite you to please enter such entries and output in the ooRexx language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 23:44, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

== Vote: Walter 1, Gerard 0 ==

There is no reason to limit a demonstration of a program in some language to a specific interpreter/translator/compiler, regardless of whether the competence of that translator is limited to successfully execute the source at hand.

Furthermore, I would kindly ask you to stop this discussion in this public place, because it is damaging to the reputation of the language. I spend a lot of time to explain the merits of all Rexx versions to people, and I am not pleased to see that when I succeed in attracting someone's attention - which is not hard with Rexx' power and simplicity -and they do a quick google for some examples, they land into a discussion of infinitesimal details by older men with nothing better on their hands.

Gerard, I know that Mark has introduced a special flag for Regina to keep you happy. I hope your crusade against ooRexx is not fed by personal ressentiment because the ooRexx team was not so forthcoming. Do realize that the differences you hint at are microscopic compared to the differences in implementations of languages that are called VB(A) or CSS, or Prolog or LISP for that matter. I do thank you for submitting the Rexx programs and correcting the incompatibilities. Whether they are illustrated with examples in ooRexx, Regina, VM Rexx, TSO Rexx, MUSIC/SP Rexx, Brexx or others is of no consequence.

This discussion might give the uninitiated reader the impression that Rexx is an incoherent mess, which it is not, it is exactly the opposite. Not many programming languages are standardized, and with such high quality of standard as Rexx. The young people I show examples of what it can do, in different versions on different platforms, are impressed by it, and some look for tools to run it on their own laptops, phones or tablets. Please help them instead of discouraging them.

-----

I'm sorry if you think that I'm crusading against ooRexx, I am not.   I have never said anything bad on Rosetta Code or in newsgroups against ooRexx (I don't consider differences a bad thing).   (Also, I don't know what you refer to when you mentioned my personal resentment about the ooRexx team not being forthcoming).   It seems there are a lot of misfounded rumors going around, and this is no place for such things, even if mentioned in passing.   But once spoken here, it stays here forever.   The main issue here (if you had read the long discussions) is the separation of ooRexx output (here on Rosetta Code) from the Classic REXX entries.   You may have noticed that ooRexx and NetRexx have their own language sections separate from (Classic) REXX (on Rosetta Code).   One intent (but not the only one) is to keep ooRexx solutions and it's syntax, features, etc, in a language section ('''ooRexx''') that focuses on ooRexx (and not the differences from Classic REXX, which isn't the intent on Rosetta Code).   The same issue with NetRexx, but NetRexx never had this problem.   Another big point is the definition of what Classic REXX is, which, when not clearly (or not in agreement) defined, is causing cross-posting and begat this long thread.   As I understand it, the purpose of Rosetta Code is to show off various languages (and dialects, etc), not to show the differences between languages in a detailed way, but what each language can do (and how it can be programmed to accomplish any of the Rosetta Code's many tasks).   It is to this end that I've entered (I think) over 800 different versions of REXX programs in the (Classic) '''REXX''' language section (representing over 600 Rosetta Code tasks (problems, if you will).   I agree that this discussion shouldn't have taken place here on Rosetta Code, but once Pandora's Box was opened in a public forum, I had to answer a question posed directly to me by name (and many others), and here we are, arguing about the definition(s) (or lack of it/them) here, and what language sections on Rosetta Code are for.   It appears that when I answer a point, several more queries are raised, and I always try to answer direct questions posed to me, even if takes a few words.   I don't believe that REXX is an incoherent mess, but the term '''Classic REXX''' does need a good definition (as well as '''a Classic REXX interpreter''') that can be agreed to by all (at least on Rosetta Code); this would be a moot point if ooRexx entries (and/or output) would've been placed in the '''ooRexx''' Rosetta Code language section. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 18:55, 18 September 2014 (UTC)  

But, I disagree about ''why'' Mark (Hessling) did.   I hoped he didn't add a special flag just to keep me happy.   It was a response to a Regina "bug" (that I reported), or rather, a feature/option of Regina that isn't part of any Classic REXX standard (this is the use of the     '''--'''     as a REXX comment indicator);   I had expressed a possible need for such a switch so that Regina could be run as ANSI compliant REXX. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 18:55, 18 September 2014 (UTC)

== This page is now displaying properly again! ==

I traced this problem back to when the Tcl entry was added on 26 March 2014, probably because of the size of the output (virtually the whole unicode character table).

With apologies to the author of this entry (Dkf), I've restricted the output to the first 256 characters and, thankfully, the problem now seems to be fixed. --[[User:PureFox|PureFox]] ([[User talk:PureFox|talk]]) 16:22, 18 September 2017 (UTC)
