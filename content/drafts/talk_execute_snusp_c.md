==Author's notes==

I've called this interpreter '''snuspi''' (SNUSP Interpreter). I wrote this interpreter before entering RosettaCode as contributors, and already realesed it as GPL code on my site. Nonetheless I was ''introduced'' to SNUSP through RosettaCode, since when I discovered this wiki, I read some pages and for the first time I saw SNUSP code at these pages. From there, I landed on Esolangs Wiki and read more about SNUSP specs. Then decided to write my own implementation to test some ideas I've had.

So ''technically'' I did not write snuspi for RosettaCode, but surely it is a RosettaCode's merit if now I know SNUSP and have written an interpreter. I hope this is not an issue.
