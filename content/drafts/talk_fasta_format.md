==FASTA file specifications==

I didn't know how much of the FASTA file specifications were to be implemented (supported), so for the REXX example (version 2), I took what I could glean from the WIKI article and supported:

* blank lines
* lines that start with a semicolon [<code>;</code>]
* lines that end with an asterisk [<code>*</code>]
* data lines that contain blanks, tabs, and other whitespace



No attempt was made to format lines that contain   <code>‚êã</code>   (vertical tabs, U+0000B) which can be used to specify multiple lines in one record.

== "Quality"? ==

I am dubious of the "quality of implementation" claim on the original page.  Some laptops purchased last year had 32GB memory and many had 16GB. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 21:01, 20 April 2013 (UTC)
