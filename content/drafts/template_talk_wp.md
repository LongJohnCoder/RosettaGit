I thought MediaWiki had an interwiki link feature that could be used for this purpose. Links would take the form <nowiki>[[wikipedia:Page Title]]</nowiki>. It apparently requires the setup and use of an interwiki map in the SQL database.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interwiki_linking .--[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 13:57, 20 February 2008 (MST)
