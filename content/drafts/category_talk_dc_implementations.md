== Confusing not really DC in BusyBox ==

Quoting https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html at 20190227-1940-GMT:

== dc ==

dc expression...

Tiny RPN calculator. Operations: +, add, -, sub, *, mul, /, div, %, mod, **, exp, and, or, not, eor, p - print top of the stack (without altering the stack), f - print entire stack, o - pop the value and set output radix (value must be 10 or 16). Examples: 'dc 2 2 add' -> 4, 'dc 8 8 * 2 2 + /' -> 16.

End of quote.

How can this non-implementation be mentioned?
Should it?
