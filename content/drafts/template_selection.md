{{infobox_begin}}'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is part of [[User:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]]'s '''[[:Category:Selection/{{{1}}}/{{{2}}}|{{{2}}}]]''' selection.{{infobox_end}}<includeonly>[[Category:Selection/{{{1}}}/{{{2}}}]]</includeonly><noinclude>

### Purpose

This template is intended to allow users to curate their own sets of tasks that they find notable or worthy of drawing attention to. The reasons are sure to vary from curator to curator, but may easily include particularly good examples of a particular language, computational problem or exercise.

### Usage

If your username is Braak, and you wanted to put a page in a selection named Sordid, would put <nowiki>{{{Selection|Braak|Sordid}}}</nowiki> following the <nowiki>{{{task}}}</nowiki>.

If you're Tick, then you're not Braak.  Don't put pages in Braak's selection; That's his namespace. You can create a selection with the exact same name, and it won't conflict with his. Yours would find a home in [[:Category:Selection/Tick/Sordid]], while his would find a home in [[:Category:Selection/Braak/Sordid]]. You could cooperate with Brak, though, and maintain one jointly. Just be sure to respond if anyone asks you why you're adding pages to Braak's set. MediaWiki doesn't have flexible access controls, but it does have people with flexible ban privileges, and it would be best if those weren't used due to a misunderstanding.

### Changes

I'm considering this a draft template for now; Some pages are likely to see multiple uses of it, and for scenarios like that, I'd really prefer to have a set of start/item/end templates. That said, I wanted to get folks to start thinking about the idea of curations.  Also, I would prefer joint curations over separate curations with the same goals, and I realize that the linking to <nowiki>[[User:{{{1}}}]]</nowiki> makes that tricky, but I would want to set up a '''User Group:''' namespace, first. (listings could be easily maintained using the MCS page.)
