=What is this?=
I noticed this the other day and don't know what to make of it.  It isn't a new language entry or even a task, it seems to be just an isolated solution without any context relevant to the rest of the site.  Just wondering what the intent of this is? --[[User:Dgamey|Dgamey]] 01:39, 6 January 2012 (UTC)
:Someone started a conversation [[User talk:Nigel Galloway|here]] about it. Maybe that will work out. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 02:05, 6 January 2012 (UTC)
: It's apparently in something called [[:Category:Mathprog|Mathprog]], for which a page was created (after this one). No, I've got no idea what the actual capabilities of the language are (or what this task is doing). â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 11:57, 6 January 2012 (UTC)
:: from the name of the page, and the description mentioning graphs it appears to be related to [[wp:Ramsey's theorem|Ramsey's theorem]]--[[User:EMBee|eMBee]] 12:21, 6 January 2012 (UTC)
