==Highlighting==
Is this enough of a lisp dialect to be using <tt>lisp</tt> for syntax highlighting? –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 16:21, 2 March 2010 (UTC)

I don't think we should be using the same tags for "lisp dialects", though using "lisp" as a fallback (and splitting off Common Lisp) might be a good idea. One of the useful functions of syntax highlighting is to highlight exactly what's a builtin operator vs. a definition made in the code. "Lisp dialects" are sufficiently different from each other that highlighting designed ''for a different dialect'' can be highly misleading. —[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 16:43, 2 March 2010 (UTC)
