Would it be terrible to indicate here in which direction the code pointer starts?
How about direction associated with the $ instruction?  Split creates a new thread in reversed direction.  Discovered by reading [https://github.com/cybojanek/befunge/blob/master/befunge/BefungeProgram.py a befunge interpreter].  Thanks.
