{{#set:is contribution page=true}}If for some reason, you found this page before you found [[:Category:Solutions by Programming Language|the language list]], 
you might want to check that out first.

=Precheck=

Before you add anything to this page...

==Is this the right place?==

* If you're looking for more information on a specific programming language, and we don't have any information on the language you're interested in, you may [[Help:Request a new programming language|request it]] on another page.
* If you're looking how to do something ''specific'' in a language, see [[Help:Request a new programming task]].  But don't forget to check the [[:Category:Solutions by Programming Task|existing tasks]], first.

==It is the right place?==

If you would like more information about a language that already has a page, add the language to a list below.  If the language is already on the list, but we still don't have much information on it, go on to "Getting your request fulfilled".

= Getting your request fulfilled =

If a regular Rosetta Code contributor knows the language you're asking about, 
(s)he may write some code.  If none of the regular contributors knows the language, then it may not get any code.

You can also try bringing in people from outside Rosetta Code.

* If you know someone who knows the language (or any language in this list), we'd be happy if you pointed them in our direction.
* If you have Twitter, tweeting out a request that someone add content for your language would probably also be good. Add '''@rosettacode''', and RC's twitter presence may retweet you.
* If you have Facebook, post on the [http://www.facebook.com/pages/RosettaCodeorg/199439093012 Facebook page].
