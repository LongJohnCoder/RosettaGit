== Stupid ==

This means that nearly every C1R "solution" in Rosetta is simply a heading, followed by string which gives the path name to the C solution.

This is a form of redudnancy that is effectively spam.

* David St. Hubbins: It's such a fine line between stupid, and uh...
* Nigel Tufnel: Clever.
* David St. Hubbins: Yeah, and clever.

: Should Rosetta Code delete every C1R solution? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:38, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
:: One of the requirements for being listed on RC is that there be a working implementation of the language. If there's a C compiler which has been extended to retrieve C code from RC and compile it, as part of processing the compiler's input, then I'd suppose it qualifies. It's bizarre, but, then, so are a few of the languages on the site. If there's a working implementation, I'd say leave it. It's far saner to be neutral about language inclusion than to try to decide what's appropriate and what's not. The rules on distinctions will tend to come around and bite one on the rear later on. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:55, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
: this one is a bit closer to clever than [[C0H]]. it could evolve into a rosettacode testing tool. possibly even with support for multiple languages. as such it would have a place here, however, i would not call it a language. 
: instead it could be a task: ''write a tool that downloads the solution to a given task in a given language, displays the source and asks the user to run it: (yes/no).''--[[User:EMBee|eMBee]] 02:47, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
:: That sounds like fun. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:55, 22 November 2011 (UTC)

LOL! Thanks. What a language! --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 06:03, 22 November 2011 (UTC)

:You're welcome. I created only 3 C1R solutions. Then I saw that there were hundreds more tasks to be done; that was too much. 
:I considered building a shell script that would check all C solutions for accompanying C1R solutions, and that would post the missing ones. 
:But I was too lazy, and feared being branded as a spammer :-) [[User:André van Delft|André van Delft]] 01:30, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
