I take it that Visual BASIC has been 'omit from'-d because it lacks native support, rather than because a solution could be constructed, yes? [[User:Axtens|Axtens]] 06:21, 29 June 2011 (UTC)

:Indeed. Someone can still implement methods remove the omission tag. As you say, it is not native to the language. For some languages that have a debugger, the debugger will keep track whilst the code is compiled or run in debug mode. However, this information becomes non available at operational runtime. I will add some notes to the omission tags. --[[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 06:28, 29 June 2011 (UTC)
