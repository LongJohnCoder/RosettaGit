Windows Forms is an API for creating graphical user interfaces in the .NET Framework. The classes map to native Windows controls in .NET while they are drawn manually in Mono to ensure platform independence. It resides in the <code>System.Windows.Forms</code> namespace in the .NET Base Class Library.
