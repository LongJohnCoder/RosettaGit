re: [[wp:Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rosetta_Code]]

Personally it would be a shame not to have [[wp:Rosetta_Code]] as RC compliment's WP perfectly by providing a spectrum of alternative programming solutions to WP's own limited code examples. 

On the other hand I suspect the RC is getting to a point that "google" will often rank RC and WP equal for the same topic. Moreover not having RC on WP is no big deal as "google" knows all about RC.

The WP editor that "contributed" does not specifically look like a [[wp:deletionist]], as a deletionist would likely wait for a "cool down" and then re "contribute" to [[wp:Articles_for_deletion]] until the page succumbs.

<s>'''keep''' - none the less, I voted '''keep'''. (If only because RC has google foo!) - [[User:NevilleDNZ|NevilleDNZ]] 21:50, 8 October 2012 (UTC)</s>

Note: I have withdrawn my '''keep''' vote at Wikipedia.  Ironically although Rosettacode is a growing resource I have not yet managed to find anything on the internet that rank Rosettacode as "Wikipedia Notable".  I can kind of see the Wikipedia's AfD editors POV.  It is a tad ironic.  (But my original assessment about RC still applies)

One thing I gained from the conversations as [[wp:Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rosetta_Code]] was the urge to do a [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=RosettaCode.org google scholarly search]  for RC and found RossettaCode.org specifically mentioned in:

Nothing all solely about RC, but global and widespread RC usage.  Maybe just the tip of an RC iceberg.

Should Rosettacode get reviewed in [[wp:Scientific America]] or [[wp:Time Magazine]] (or some other "Wikipedia Notable" article '''about''' RC) someone (with the time and energy) could update WP.  If you know of any "Wikipedia Notable" articles in the media, do let me know. I'll pass it on.
