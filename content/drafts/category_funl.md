}}FunL (pronounced "funnel") is a functional dynamically typed scripting language. The name FunL stands for "fun language", but it can also stand for "functional language".  One goal in creating FunL was to make a scripting language that would be as enjoyable and convenient to use as Python but with the added support for pattern matching and more of an "equational" style of programming.  FunL has the same kind of indentation or "off-side rule" syntax that Python has.

Another goal in creating FunL was to have a scripting language that is highly Java and Scala interoperable.  FunL is implemented in Scala and therefore relies upon both the Scala and Java runtime support libraries.
