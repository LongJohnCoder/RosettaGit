<div class="messagebox">Note: This example does not use a user-defined image type, since that would be particularly impractical, but rather draws on the calculator's graph screen, which has essentially the same operations as an implementation of [[Basic bitmap storage]] would, except for being black-and-white.</div><noinclude>

This template is for use in [[TI-83 BASIC]] and [[TI-89 BASIC]] examples whose tasks specify the use of [[Basic bitmap storage]].
