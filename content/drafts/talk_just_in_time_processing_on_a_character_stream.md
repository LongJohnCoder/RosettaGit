Good task ''except'' for this:
<blockquote>“Provide a reasonably interesting message to be decoded, e.g. Silence-Dogood. Your choice.”</blockquote>
No, absolutely definitely not. The task author should specify the sample text so that it is possible to compare results between languages. (Feel free to host the text here on a sub-page.) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 13:22, 15 December 2013 (UTC)

== Vague specification: what is "i"? ==

Where does the value i come from?

Presumably, there must be multiple values of i, since one round of this algorithm prints only one character, which is hardly a good password.

Is the program supposed to step i through sequential integers? Starting at 0? 1? Or is a sequence of i values to be provided?

== What is the meaning of "Just In Time" here? ==

This looks like a straightforward "batch" stream processing task.
