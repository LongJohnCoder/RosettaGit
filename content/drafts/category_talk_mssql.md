== Reason for removal ==

As I understand it, "MSSQL" is not a programming language but a database management system which uses either [[Transact-SQL]] (T-SQL) or [[SQL]] as query languages (see also [[wp:Mssql|Wikipedia]]). Furthermore, the page [[MS SQL]] already redirects to [[Transact-SQL]].

If this page is removed, the following pages should probably also be removed:
* [[Reports:Tasks_not_implemented_in_MSSQL]]
* [[:Category:MSSQL_examples_needing_attention]]
* [[:Category:MSSQL_Implementations]]
* [[:Category:MSSQL_User]]
