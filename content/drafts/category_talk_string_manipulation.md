I created this category after I realised that text processing already existed. Sorry. But people do seem to have added to it despite that so perhaps it is useful to have both. [[User:Oligomous|Oligomous]] 23:14, 9 August 2009 (UTC)
: I think it is OK. Text processing is about texts, i.e. a specific kind of human readable documents. String manipulation is about operations on the abstract string data type. It can be used in text processing, but it is not an equivalent of. Certain specific string manipulation algorithms are of no interest for text processing. AFAIK in molecular biology DNA sequences are handled as strings etc.  --[[User:Dmitry-kazakov|Dmitry-kazakov]] 06:41, 10 August 2009 (UTC)
