The directions for this task speak of using the time for various purposes. This appears to be intended only as a comment, and not as direction for the task.

== UNIX time milestone ==

UNIX time will be hitting 1234567890 next Friday (the 13th) at 23:31:30 GMT. That might be a good time to celebrate something. If you're concerned about milliseconds too, this milestone comes close enough to 1234567890123 (123 ms later) for milliseconds since the epoch. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:09, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

==erroneous/wrongful HTML code changes==

The user SISKUS changed the formatting of the REXX <nowiki> <lang> </nowiki> html tags and caused some text to be on one long line, not exactly an error, but it made the text harder to find and edit.   I changed it back (reinstated the original text), and the formatting was again changed to the long line, along with a query on the summary line of ''(Why coders are not able to write MarkUp code?''), along with still more changes of the same to other language entries.   Since no other changes were made, I can only assume that the question/query was directed at me and my reinstatement of the original code (which isn't really the proper forum for a question of ''why''), disregarding the minor insult.   I would normally post something like this on the SISKUS talk page, but so far, he hasn't responded to any of my past postings there.   Since then, many more changes have been made to this Rosetta Code task and another task page (that I know of), including changing of highlighted text (as in boldface texts/headings), removal of the <nowiki> 
```txt
 and 
```
 </nowiki> tags and other html tag removals.   Can these erroneous/wrongful changes be reversed and/or addressed?   There are too many to address separately, and I certainly don't want to start an editing/revision/undo contest, but I did revert the first erroneous change back to the original.   Since the erroneous/wrongful/whatever changes started with the REXX entry, and given the history between Rosetta Code REXX entries and the SISKUS user, I can only assume that it's either personal or directed at REXX entries specifically.   Other changes (to another Rosetta Code task) had the summary statement of ''Superfluous markup code removed'', but it didn't remove any superfluous html code that I could see (but it did remove some html code that was needed), it just abutted several html codes together which didn't change the output rendering, but just made the raw text harder to read.   I don't know what superfluous markup code was actually removed (if any), I can only examine what the REXX entry had for html tags and I can only see that they were abutted, nothing was removed.   Now, I won't tell him how or what to change for other people's (language) entries, but I sure mind it when the text that I entered is much harder to read and maintain; the recent changes serve no purpose.   As far as the numerous other uses of <nowiki> <lang> </nowiki> html tags that immediatly follow another html tag such as <nowiki> {{works with}} </nowiki> or somesuch, the <nowiki> <lang> </nowiki> almost always starts on a new line (in the raw text), it just makes it easier to find/locate it when it's being edited.   I see now benefit of removing a blank and have those two html tags on one line.   The renderings of either one are identical. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 23:21, 23 June 2014 (UTC)
