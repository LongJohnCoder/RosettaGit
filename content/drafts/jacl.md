{{implementation|Tcl}}[[runs on vm::java virtual machine| ]]
'''Jacl''' is an implementation of [[Tcl]] written in [[Java]] rather than the (more common) [[C]] version shared by [[tclsh]] and [[wish]]. The current version does not implement quite the same version of the language, does not include any support for [[Tk]], and instead includes a package for closer Java integration (allowing the use of the [[AWT]], [[Swing]], SWT, etc. for GUIs if desired).

<blockquote>''Consider using [[JTcl]] instead, which supports a larger fraction of the Tcl language and has more active developers working on it.''</blockquote>
