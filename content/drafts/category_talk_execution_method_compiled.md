I suppose there perhaps ought to be another type of compiled here: where a language is compiled into another language. I can remember using a [[Modula-3]] implementation that worked that way (going to [[C]], IIRC). â€”[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 14:45, 4 August 2009 (UTC)
:You can make more if you can think of them. You need to make the category page under this one, and you need to add another case to the "exec" section in [[Template:Language]] (assuming that's still where people want it). --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:10, 4 August 2009 (UTC)
