GridScript is a fairly new and not yet implemented esoteric language defined by user SuperJedi224.

Each command in a GridScript program is assigned to a point on a virtual 2-dimensional grid. A program tracer moving through this grid executes the commands as it reaches these points.

Data can be stored in a 2-dimensional dataspace, a single stack-like "buffer", and an arbitrary number of variables. The dataspace may only store INTs; the other two structures my store INTs, FLOATs, BOOLs, or STRINGs.
