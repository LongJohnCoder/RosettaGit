==OEIS A000315==
The step of multiplying by n! * (n-1)! to compare to A002860 looks unnecessary.
A002860 says (in its "Formula" section) that it is "n!*(n-1)!*A000315(n)".
So, it would be more direct to just have us compare the number of reduced Latin Squares against OEIS A000315.

:I hope that on completion of this task the contributer has appreciated that this is a key to generating all Latin Squares (A002860). I could add taking the set of order 4, creating for all 4! permutations of the columns all 3! permutations of rows 2 to 4 and verifying that each Latin Square so produced is unique, thus proving that it does so, if the consensus is that such is needed. Certainly anyone doubting it should do so. Adding OEIS A00031 as a reference not a problem.--[[User:Nigel Galloway|Nigel Galloway]] ([[User talk:Nigel Galloway|talk]]) 19:32, 13 July 2019 (UTC)
