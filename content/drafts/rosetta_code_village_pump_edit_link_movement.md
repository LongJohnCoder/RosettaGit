</math>Aha! Found it! [[Visual Basic .NET]]. If you hover over the edit link on the right you'll see that it goes to the "See Also" section which is a few inches up (on my screen). --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 16:46, 21 July 2009 (UTC)
:That's Weird with a Capital 'Huh?' ... It looks like a quirky incompatibility between the CSS styles used for the sideboxes and those of the Monobook theme.  See if there's any difference between the HOPL box and the Language box's core CSS. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 16:52, 21 July 2009 (UTC)
::The HOPL template has no CSS. It's just text in the language box. The edit link just showed up at the end of the language div box (class infobox). I'm not sure what else to look at to figure that out. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 17:02, 21 July 2009 (UTC)
