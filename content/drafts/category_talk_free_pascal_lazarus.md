FreePascal/Lazarus should not be a category because it is not a particular Pascal dialect like ObjectPascal or iso-Pascal, but a compiler which actually implements several dialects. Therefore, it is more appropriate to put examples to the general Pascal category and add the "<nowiki>{{works with|Free_Pascal}}</nowiki>" label. This policy also prevents fragmentation in the presentation of the language. Since there is already a wiki page for FreePascal as an implementation (speak: compiler) of Pascal, I pledge for the removal of this category. --[[User:Mischi|Mischi]] 15:20, 28 January 2012 (UTC)
