{{Vptopic

|summary=Downloading Language examples allows searching thru all the code
}}
Is there some way to download all the example code for a language?  If this downloaded code had example titles embedded in it this would allow searching for either a specific example or specific language constructs.
:That would be nice, wouldn't it? We had some discussions [[Rosetta Code:Village Pump/RC extraction Tool and Task|here]] about it. You may want to join in there and see if those people can start thinking about it again. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 17:45, 22 March 2012 (UTC)
