== This is not a fractal ==

This is not a fractal. Fractals are self-similar under different magnifications. This pattern is not. It would be more accurate to refer to this task as "Fibonacci packing" or "Phi packing" See http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat2.html and https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/nature-golden-ratio-fibonacci.html.
