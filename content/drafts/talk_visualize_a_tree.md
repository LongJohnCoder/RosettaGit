== Fuzzy task, I know ==

This is something that could be useful for a lot of things. I'm hoping people will focus on the intent (probably some code that can be reused easily to do some good) rather than an exact specification, though it's only natural to expect (for example) some Lisp people dump an unindented S-expression verbatim and be done with it. --[[User:Ledrug|Ledrug]] 00:46, 1 September 2012 (UTC)

==Output?==
Do you want to add that output should be shown on the task page? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 09:14, 1 September 2012 (UTC)
: A small example wouldn't hurt, but I don't know what people can come up with, so I'd rather leave that to others. --[[User:Ledrug|Ledrug]] 01:28, 2 September 2012 (UTC)
