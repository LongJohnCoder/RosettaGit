== Duplicate? ==

Isn't that a duplicate of [[:Category:68000 Assembly]]? Isn't the instruction set the same for all members of the M68k family like it is for the members of Intel's [[:Category:X86 Assembly|x86]] family? --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 19:12, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
