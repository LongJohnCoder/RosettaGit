==Why is it a language when it describes itself as a module?==
Hi Legrady. Why choose to elevate a module to full-blown language status? It doesn't seem as if Perl5i has much treatment as a separate language elsewhere. Why not just treat it as a style of Perl programming and add your example under the Perl heading but maybe with a sub-heading of "Using Perl5i"? 

If I search for Netrexx then right upfront it is defined as being a separate language than Rexx. Searching for Perl5i I [http://search.cpan.org/~noirin/perl5i-v2.11.2/lib/perl5i.pm#DESCRIPTION find] it described as a Perl5 module.
