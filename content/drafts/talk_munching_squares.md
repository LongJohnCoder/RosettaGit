I guess someone has to say it: what are the task specifications here? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:19, 25 November 2011 (UTC)
: I dunno, but I guess that it's at least ''intended'' to be a task so I marked it as a draft. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 15:55, 26 November 2011 (UTC)
::This task looks pretty stable but the description still seems like it doesn't have enough to it. the "color table" part seems kind of confusing. Maybe there's a different way of saying the same thing that doesn't invalidate the other examples? If we could get that filled in then I think this task is ready to move up. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 13:10, 22 March 2012 (UTC)
:::Yeah, I think we need a wikipedia link for "color table", but other than that there are no issues. This task looks ready for promotion. [[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 07:30, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

Also, this is very very similar to [[Sierpinski_triangle]] and [[Sierpinski_triangle/Graphical]] (xor method).  Mind you it is very pretty too :) --[[User:Dgamey|Dgamey]] 13:07, 26 November 2011 (UTC)
