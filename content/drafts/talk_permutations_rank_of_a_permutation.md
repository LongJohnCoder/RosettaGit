==  Python: Recursions as iterations ==
Thanks spoon for making the change, but are we now too far from the Myrvold & Ruskey paper that the functions are based on? An alternative is too add your update as a separate set of examples, but that is up to you - I can go either way.

I do like your use of randrange. Neat :-)

:I have changed them back, but kept the unrankers as loops, but kept them as close to the original code as possible.
:By the way, the previous use of <code>randint</code> was wrong. <code>randint(0, perms)</code> generates numbers from 0 to perms (inclusive), like <code>randrange(perms+1)</code>. --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] 04:19, 27 October 2012 (UTC)
::Ah, I understand that now - O read that about randint but failed to notice the significance, Thanks again. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 08:13, 27 October 2012 (UTC)

==J A.==
I just love it that J has a primitive that has this built in.  I'm impressed as I thought twice about creating the task as my Python code was not short and I thought the subject might be too specialized and not attract any interest. The interest of two others is great.  (I'll keep an eye out for something with a simple solution that I can turn into a future task too). --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 12:54, 27 October 2012 (UTC)
