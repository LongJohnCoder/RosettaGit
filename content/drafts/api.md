[[Category:Encyclopedia]]An '''API''' (or '''application programming interface''') is a source code interface that an [[:Category:Operating Systems|operating system]] or [[Libraries|library]] provides to support requests for services to be made of it by programs. It is a description of instructions and/or codes for using an OS or library. [[Microsoft]] distributes the API for [[Windows]] publicly so that programs can be easily written for it. [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] JavaDocs for [[Java]] are another example.
