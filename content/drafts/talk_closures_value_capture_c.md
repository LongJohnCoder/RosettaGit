Heh, [[wp:Greenspun's tenth rule]] anyone? --[[User:Ledrug|Ledrug]] 00:45, 1 October 2011 (UTC)
:Note that this is introduced in the main Closures/Variable_capture page as "Greenspunned mini Lisp dialect". Anything which says it deliberately invokes Greenspun's tenth (from the very beginning) actually, paradoxically, doesn't. Real greenspunned projects are staffed by developers who are unaware that this is happening. :) [[Special:Contributions/192.139.122.42|192.139.122.42]] 01:35, 1 October 2011 (UTC)
