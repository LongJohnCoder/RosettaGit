== Perl 6 ==> Raku ==

So, now it's Raku. Any precedent for renaming a language a Rosetta Code? --[[User:SqrtNegInf|SqrtNegInf]] ([[User talk:SqrtNegInf|talk]]) 23:31, 14 October 2019 (UTC)

:Well, Protuim got renamed to Peloton back in 2016 and that was a large pain in the butt... even though there was only about 40 or so Protium tasks completed and less than 6 months of history at the time. I did all the fix-up manually then. For this? It's going to be scripted if at all. 1100 and some-odd tasks and 10 years of history, commentary and talk to comb through? << Shudder >> Plus we'll lose syntax highlighting, so that's a major LTA too. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 12:11, 15 October 2019 (UTC)
