ntheory is Perl module available on CPAN as [https://metacpan.org/pod/ntheory ntheory] or [https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Prime::Util Math::Prime::Util].  It adds fast integer number theory functions using either GMP, C, or pure Perl.

Highlights include:

* Generating and iterating over primes or composites

* Fast primality tests for both small and large integers

* Primality proofs including BLS75 and ECPP

* Primality certificate verification

* Random primes and random provable primes

* Integer factoring and DLP

* Fast prime counts and nth prime using LMO

* prime count and nth prime approximations and bounds

* Simple partition, divisor, combination, and permutation iterators
