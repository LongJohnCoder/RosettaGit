== What information does this convey? ==

Since the entire site is in english, and most all of our profiles are in english, what information is conveyed by tagging our profiles with "speaks english"?  (I can see that nationality is being conveyed, but this tag does not seem designed for that purpose.) --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] 19:48, 1 August 2011 (UTC)
:It's kind of just for fun. I think there are a few users whose native language is German. [[User:Dmitry-kazakov]] speaks Russian (though he hasn't been around for a while). It's just a little nice-to-know tidbit (just like [[Property:Programs for]]). --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:05, 1 August 2011 (UTC)
