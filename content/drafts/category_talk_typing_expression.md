== Explanation? ==

I'm not sure exactly what "type expression" means in this context (I assume something to do with whether the compiler can infer types of variables). Can someone add a description? --[[User:Mr2001|Mr2001]] 19:15, 24 October 2010 (UTC)
:That's how I've interpreted it. If you don't have to declare the type of a variable then the type expression is implicit.--[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:48, 24 October 2010 (UTC)
