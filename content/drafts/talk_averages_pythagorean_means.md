==Why all three together?==
I know we already have the [[Averages/Arithmetic mean]] task. We needed the other two, they all seemed very small and were related, so I created the one task for all three. It will also allow easy comparison of one languages computation of all three, for example Python has to delve into its standard library for the geometric mean. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 05:31, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

==A >= G >= H missing?==
It is like going back and fixing the question when you got the answer wrong ;-)

On reading the wp article it seemed like a useful little fact about the Pythagorean means, (apart from the nifty little semi-circular diagram), that I want to have in the RC task. I think it should be re-instated and the examples fixed. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 01:35, 22 February 2010 (UTC)

Note that the second element to the task [http://rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Averages/Pythagorean_means&oldid=75253 was] in the original task description; missed by some, but not others. I decided to move it to make it more prominent. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 01:59, 22 February 2010 (UTC)


==Formulae hidden to most browsers by under-tested cosmetic edits at 23:05, 3 June 2016 ==

Under-tested cosmetic edits made to the task page at 23:05, 3 June 2016, including the injection of spaces around expressions in &lt;math&gt; tags, made 3 out of the 4 task description formulae completely invisible to all browsers which display the graphic file version of formulae rather than processing the MathML (this is, in fact, the majority of browsers). The MediaWiki processor does not currently expect such spaces, and generates syntactically ill-formed HTML if they are introduced. Other aspects of these cosmetic edits may further compound the problem. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 10:31, 24 September 2016 (UTC)
