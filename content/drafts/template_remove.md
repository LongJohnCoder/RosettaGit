This template puts this page in the [[:Category:Pages to Remove|category of pages to delete]], deletion being an operation that is for administrators only.

A reason for the proposed deletion should be given, as the first (and so far only) argument. With a reason, e.g., <tt><nowiki>{{remove|it's spam}}</nowiki></tt>, the above alertbox changes to something like this:

{{alertbox|#ffc8c8|''Administrator, please remove this page, because it's spam!''}}
{{template}}</noinclude>
