<big>'''Rosetta Code has a presence on IRC.'''</big>

Point your favorite IRC client to <tt>irc.freenode.net</tt>, and join #rosettacode.  Mind you, there may not be anyone active.  But if you stick around long enough, someone will respond.

==IRC clients==
You'll need to use an IRC client to connect to the IRC server.


### Web Browser

You can visit Rosetta Code's IRC channel via your web browser on the [[Special:WebChat]] page.


### Linux

* [http://www.xchat.org/ XChat] should come with your distribution

### Unix

* [http://www.irssi.org/ irssi]

### Windows

* [http://www.mirc.com/get.html mIRC] is a popular Windows IRC client.
* Another choice is [http://silverex.info SilverEx XChat], a free windows build of XChat.

### Windows and Linux

* [http://www.pidgin.im/ Pidgin/Finch] works with other chat protocols as well as IRC.

### Mac

* [http://colloquy.info/ Colloquy]

==Logging==
Logging is stalled and has been for some time. Anyone who feels like making a logging bot should talk to people (especially Short Circuit) in the IRC channel. A complete listing of logs of the channel are available on request.

==Evaluators==

We have some evaluator bots for the languages on Rosetta Code. Here's how to invoke each one in the channel:

{|
! Language !! Prefix !! Bot
|-
| [[E]] || “<code>eel: </code>” || eel
|-
| [[Haskell]] || “<code>&gt; </code>” || lambdabot
|}
