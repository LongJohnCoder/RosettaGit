I think it would be nice to do some tasks with the wiktionary dumps:

[https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/20190420/ https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/20190420/]

The complete dump is a big bz2'ed XML file of about 800MB so it's quite interesting to see how to handle it!

but I lack imagination right now to find an interesting task, so I post here in hope to get more inspired people :)

:Maybe a simple translation program, create a database with English and French words for example and a utility to get translations from a given word.

:Maybe recreate the kind of files like "/usr/share/dict/french" or [https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/ap/linuxwords linuxwords]
