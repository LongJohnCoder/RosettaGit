[[Category:Ada_Versions]]'''Ada 2005''' or '''Ada 05''' was the latest language revision defined by an amendment to the [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=22983 ISO/IEC 8652] standard. The amendment was published in 2007, though the revision itself was completed two years earlier. Therefore the language version is referred as Ada 2005.

The language received [[Java]]-like interfaces to provide a limited support for multiple-[[inheritance]] as well as better integration of tasking and protected types. The standard language library was sufficiently extended with predefined containers and matrix operations.
