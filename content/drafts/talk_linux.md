==GNU/Linux==

I linked "GNU/Linux" to [[wp:GNU/Linux naming controversy]] because that gives a very thorough discussion of, well, everything related to the whole "GNU/Linux" thing, and ''not'' <s>because it's a "controversy"</s> for any other reason. The other obvious choices were [[wp:Linux#GNU.2FLinux]] or just no link. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 07:55, 7 October 2011 (UTC) (updated [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 19:11, 7 October 2011 (UTC))
