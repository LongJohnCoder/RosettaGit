|summary=Perhaps rename tasks that use -ing verbs ("Boxing the compass" => "Box the compass")
}}

I propose to rename several tasks that use -ing verbs (present participles).

* [[Boxing the compass]] => Box the compass
* [[Calling an object method]] => Call an object method
* [[Counting in factors]] => Count in factors
* [[Counting in octal]] => Count in octal
* [[DNS querying]] => DNS query
* [[Function prototyping]] => Function prototype
* [[GUI enabling/disabling of controls]] => Enable/disable GUI controls
* [[Loading animated 3D data]] => Load animated 3D data
* [[Making the application start up from a main routine]] => Start from a main routine
* [[Parsing command-line arguments]] => Parse command-line arguments
* [[Terminal control/Cursor positioning]] => Terminal control/Position the cursor
* [[Terminal control/Hiding the cursor]] => Terminal control/Hide the cursor
* [[Terminal control/Ringing the terminal bell]] => Terminal control/Ring the terminal bell
* [[URL decoding]] => Decode URL
* [[URL encoding]] => Encode URL
* [[Using a Speech engine to highlight words]] => Highlight words with a speech engine

These new names would remove inconsistencies (as in [[Call a function]] versus [[Calling an object method]]) and follow similar changes (''[[Reversing a string]]'' => [[Reverse a string]], ''[[Sorting Using a Custom Comparator]]'' => [[Sort using a custom comparator]]). My list omits some tasks where the -ing words are more like nouns ([[Huffman coding]]) or adjectives ([[Playing cards]]). I will start later when I have time to use the "move" tab. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:53, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

Is there a way to keep the Speech engine from "Using a speech engine ..." at the front of the title, as it is more important. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 06:05, 19 August 2011 (UTC)

: I feel similarly about URL encoding and URL decoding. [[User:CRGreathouse|CRGreathouse]] 21:23, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
