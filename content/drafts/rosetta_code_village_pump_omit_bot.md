We should probably have a one time bot to create the Lang/Omit categories. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:37, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
: I can have ImplSearchBot do it during its updates; It's not actually a one-time operation, as we will continue to have new languages added to RC over time. (We've got less than 200...and there are thousands out there.  And thousands that haven't yet been invented.)  I'll create a category for which all the Omit cats will be subcats for, and that will help prevent unnecessary page edits. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 22:06, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
::I just added [[Template:Omit cat]] for use on those category pages. Change the text if you want. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:37, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
