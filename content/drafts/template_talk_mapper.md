Hi, and especially to Userid:Mwn3d

I stumbled across this site, was putting in a whole new language (having started learning how to use a Wiki) and when I came back to do some more, someone had deleted my page!

Give me a break, dude!

*every* language has only one contributor, the day it's put on here.
:Hello there. I had deleted the page because this isn't how you add a language. You use {{tmpl|language}} on the category page. This template is unnecessary. I changed the category and set it up properly. If anything in the add a language instructions was cofusing let me know and I'll try to make it more clear. Try not to take offense to people fixing things quickly like that. We just want to make sure things are set up correctly. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 02:50, 9 January 2012 (UTC)
