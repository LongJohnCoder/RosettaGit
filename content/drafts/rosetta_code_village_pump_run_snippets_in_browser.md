There is a javascript plugin called klipse that allows you to run snippets of several languages in the web page and show the output. See this page http://blog.klipse.tech/ocaml/2017/10/05/blog-ocaml.html for examples. I think this would be a useful enhancement for the site and make examples of supported languages interactive.
