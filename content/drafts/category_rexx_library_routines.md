[[Category:REXX]]

This is the REXX library routines category.

"Library routines" implying library ''of'' routines, or perhaps more precisely "a loose hodge-podge of assorted REXX functions/subroutines/routines that are individually referred (invoked) by various REXX programs" rather than routines implementing library functionality.
