This special page allows you to collaborate in real time with other users of the wiki.
To connect simply press the "Connect" button.
If you are logged in your nickname will have been prefilled.
Anonymous users are given an automatically generated one, but it can be changed.

You are only connected so long as you leave this page open. If you like, put it in a separate tab, and check back once in a while. There's no attention-grabbing notification mechanism, as the actual chat is an iframe pointing to Freenode's server.
