Draft status until there are a few reasonable implementations [[User:TobyK|TobyK]] ([[User talk:TobyK|talk]]) - now full task status [[User:TobyK|TobyK]] ([[User talk:TobyK|talk]]) 13:58, 20 June 2016 (UTC)

What does that "Passwords.jpg" image on the current task page have to do with this task? --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 10:32, 25 April 2016 (UTC)

: It's hard to depict the ''generating'' of random passwords (or generating anything, for that matter, unless we're talking about movies or animated GIFs), but the jumble of (random) passwords was the closest thing that shows random passwords (albeit static passwords), plus the image was in public domain.   It's pretty hard to find good quality copyright-free images.   I thought having an image on the right-side of the Rosetta Code task is essentially unused space, and doesn't elongate the preamble part of the Rosetta Code (draft) task.   But I like it that you re-shown the JPEG image here as well. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 19:25, 25 April 2016 (UTC)

== Stack Overflow? ==

This looks to correspond to at least one stack overflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36931474/how-to-have-10-characters-total-and-make-sure-at-least-one-character-from-4-diff - I have not looked to see if there are similar questions for other programming languages. It would be interesting to know the origin of this particular requirement. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 05:02, 4 May 2016 (UTC)

I think it was reading read that question or a similar one which prompted me to make this task, but the specific requirements of characters from each group is a policy I have followed for some time and seems to be a fairly standard practice/recommendation.

most of your passwords don't have a digit (9)

Uhhh, yeah, I misread the requirements. --[[User:Craigd|CraigD]] ([[User talk:Craigd|talk]]) --03:41, 23 June 2016 (UTC)

:But meanwhile you fixed it. Thanks. --[[User:Walterpachl|Walterpachl]] ([[User talk:Walterpachl|talk]]) 07:52, 23 June 2016 (UTC)
