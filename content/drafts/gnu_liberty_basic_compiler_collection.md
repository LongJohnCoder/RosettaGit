{{implementation|Liberty BASIC}}
The '''GNU Liberty Basic Compiler Collection''' ('''GLBCC''') is a suite of tools designed to allow [[Windows]] and [[Linux]] users to compile [[:Category:Liberty BASIC|Liberty BASIC]] code to a standalone application. Despite the name, GLBCC is not part of the [[GNU]] project.

GLBCC hasn't been updated since 2002, and its compatibility with recent versions of Liberty BASIC is unknown.
