There's likely to be a great deal of debate over what tasks are appropriate, and the rules that govern each task.  I'll figure out where that discussion belongs...but I don't know a whole lot about MediaWiki, so it could take some time. (Especially considering I'm doing this while working part time and taking classes full time.)

For now, use the  [[Talk:Programming tasks|Programming Tasks]] page in the Talk: namespace.
