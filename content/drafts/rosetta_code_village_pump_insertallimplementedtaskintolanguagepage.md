[[User:Pavel Senatorov|Pavel Senatorov]] ([[User talk:Pavel Senatorov|talk]]): I use RC most all of to quickly learn some language(s) by looking some implemented tasks. But it's not convenient because requiring opening many task pages and looking this language.

But if to place all implemented by this language tasks into this language (sub)page then it will be very convenient.
