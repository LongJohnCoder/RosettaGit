IMHO "SUBCATEGORIES" of "I" "O" "P" "L" "P" "T" does not make sense here.

: Those are not subcategories, those are alphabetical headings of the subcategories. They are an automatic MediaWiki feature. --[[User:Kevin Reid|Kevin Reid]] 03:13, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

== "Encyclopedia" namespace ==

Should I drop the "Encyclopedia" namespace? I don't see that it's used. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 20:09, 19 August 2010 (UTC)
: Perhaps the pages currently in the Encyclopedia category should be moved over? --[[User:Coderjoe|Coderjoe]] 20:13, 19 August 2010 (UTC)
