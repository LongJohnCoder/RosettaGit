{{stub}}{{capability}}Graphics is, as a capability, the ability to display (or at least write to an image file) some graphical entity. The entity displayed may be a line, a curve, a rectangle, etc. Enclosed entities may or may not be filled. Note that any GUI display automatically requires graphical capability.

Writing text to a console or terminal is not generally considered graphical display as such (even though it has sometimes been used to emulate it).
