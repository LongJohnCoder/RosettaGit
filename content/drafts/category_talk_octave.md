==Naming==

Should this language category be titled "Octave" instead?  GNU Octave is merely the implementation. Or is the implementation "GNU Octave" merely a dialect of [[Matlab]], like Bash is a dialect of [[UNIX Shell]]? --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 15:19, 31 March 2009 (UTC)

: Hm, I've called GNU Octave since somewhere I've read it is better to call it so to avoid confusion with something... but I can't find the place again, and searching around I've seen that after all often it is called just Octave, so maybe it must be renamed...
: Anyway, Octave (or GNU Octave) is not a dialect of Matlab; as language, it wants to be compatible mostly with the language used by Matlab, but indeed it is not fully compatible. As far as I know, the only implementation of Octave (as language) is GNU Octave/Octave. (Not everything prepended with GNU is necessarily a GNU implementation of what follows like GNU Forth, GNU Fortran and so on). Of course being Octave "open", different implementation can exist, so...
: After R (GNU R), I agree with the renaming if I won't find clues why I've choosen GNU Octave as name instead... (and it is also shorter to write!:D) --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 16:06, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
: I'm sure the FSF would prefer it be referred to as GNU Octave, but the HOPL doesn't see it that way. (I was pondering modifying the HOPL template to allow manual specification of the language name, as there are several languages that the HOPL links fail on.)  Renaming the language category will cause quirks with ImplSearchBot, but that's just something I'll have to deal with. I say rename it. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 18:20, 31 March 2009 (UTC)

:: I've renamed all header|GNU to header|Octave... so this page can be renamed, who can... -- [[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 19:41, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
:::Not I! Apparently, my permissions don't allow renaming categories. (Strangely, I can rename the category talk page.) --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 20:03, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
:::: :D Copying to Octave and deleting? --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 21:25, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
