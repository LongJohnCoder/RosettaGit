== A strange game ==

Damn! The Tcl player keeps trouncing me... –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 23:55, 29 November 2009 (UTC)
:If you put it against itself and it tells you "the only winning move is not to play" then you should be scared. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 00:05, 30 November 2009 (UTC)
::No, be scared if it tries to guess ''launch codes''. (I gotta go play me some [[wp:DEFCON (video game)|DEFCON]] now...) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 00:31, 1 December 2009 (UTC)

== split this page? ==

Every solution is quite long.  Should this page be split like [[RCRPG]]? --[[User:Glennj|glennj]] 19:17, 17 December 2009 (UTC)
:Probably. When I was making this task, I thought of doing that and then, for no good reason, didn't. —[[User:Underscore|Underscore]] ([[User talk:Underscore|Talk]]) 23:39, 17 December 2009 (UTC)

== Rules? ==

As the rules here don't match the ones in the linked Wikipedia article (or the ones on pagat.com, or any I've ever encountered, for that matter.  Nine cards per player?  Drawing the card you asked for doesn't let you go again?), it would be good to call attention to that fact and perhaps note the source of the rules being requested.
