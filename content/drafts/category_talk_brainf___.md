I like how the name got censored. --[[Special:Contributions/169.232.238.84|169.232.238.84]] 00:10, 27 March 2010 (UTC)

:: "Offense is a complex emotion requiring a well-developed brain. Words and pictures do not have brains and so cannot be offensive. Any offense you feel is therefore your own fault. Think about this before misplacing blame." (from http://notstupid.us/ ) -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 03:05, 3 April 2010 (UTC)
::: Thus one may create a few more esolangs with names like Coon, Nigger, Wop, Dago, Poofter and Faggot and no one will bat an eyelid. Ah, how wonderful it is to enjoy freedom of speech and live in a pluralistic society. --[[User:Axtens|Axtens]] 07:17, 4 April 2010 (UTC)

:::: I think that anything more is getting off-topic for RC (and we're probably there already). This is not the place for sociological debates. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Eriksiers]] 18:22, 4 April 2010 (UTC)
:: Honestly I doubt there'd be any noise to put up with; Wikipedia gets by just fine with the uncensored version. â€”[[User:Underscore|Underscore]] ([[User talk:Underscore|Talk]]) 20:10, 3 April 2010 (UTC)

If in doubt, be polite! nothing of value is lost with the censoring. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 20:40, 4 April 2010 (UTC)
: Principle is lost. We're censoring the name of a programming language for the sake of any religious people who happen to peruse the page. If users here are anything like me and my university classmates, the censoring itself is far more offensive than the actual word being censored. --[[Special:Contributions/83.250.91.162|83.250.91.162]] 09:39, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
:: Religious? Where? Its sad when the mere mention of the word 'polite' causes such reactions. Can there really be any doubt as to the name of the language? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 13:08, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
:: I'm not (very) principled. I'm a pragmatic and have little enough time to devote to site maintenance as things stand already. I already had to poke one school about unblocking Rosetta Code because of a string that appeared in our ReCAPTCHA key. I ''know'' those same proxy filters will block anything related to this language, and I don't have time to argue with numerous unlisted campus IT department (who needs a well-organized campus directory?) so their CS and programming students can create accounts. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:16, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
::: So the only way that some university classmates can see the page to complain of its censorship is if one shows restraint. Methinks ther's a greater battle for students to enjoin. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 16:49, 9 August 2010 (UTC)

How about Pa**al, FOR****, **BOL? These names are quite offensive too! (Posted by [[User:178.140.240.108]] at 23:43, 8 January 2012 UTC )
: Do you really think I ''like'' censorship? Those languages don't get blocked by censoring proxy filters. Also, I've blocked you for one day; you may still create an account.

:: What makes you think i'm craving for the membership of the community which leader and sysop feels a butthurt from slightest critics and is so ingenious to resolve technical problems with ultimate panacea - censorsh*t?
::: Anonymous coward further "censored" for irony. --[[User:Ttmrichter|Michael T. Richter]] ([[User talk:Ttmrichter|talk]]) 00:38, 14 January 2014 (UTC)

Someday the people who think words like the one being "censored" in the title are "edgy" or somehow emblematic of an important philosophy will pass through puberty and into the realm of adulthood.  --[[User:Ttmrichter|Michael T.
