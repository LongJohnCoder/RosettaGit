I need to update the C# example to use a better XML sample. Right now I'm using a sample from online which might not always be there.

== This task makes me uncomfortable... ==

I have been working with xml, quite a lot of it, and I have noticed that typical implementations of xml support contain defects of various sorts.

Worse, the underlying specifications are.... extensive. And support for various aspects are often "best effort" (some things are sort of optional, or left to the programmer).

The net result of all this is that I expect that implementations of this task with either:

[a] Show how to hook to somebody else's implementation, or
[b] Be far too complicated for this site.

... so this makes me uncomfortable. --[[User:Rdm|Rdm]] ([[User talk:Rdm|talk]]) 22:48, 6 November 2014 (UTC)
