{{library}}'''Simple Components for Ada''' is a component library for [[Ada]]. The library provides:

* containers (sets, maps, stacks, tables, unbounded arrays, doubly-linked lists and webs);
* storage pools;
* smart pointers;
* persistence layer (based on ODBC or user-provided storage);
* string editing facilities;
* UTF-8 support;
* expression analyzers;
* lock-free data structures (FIFOs and blackboards);
* synchronization primitives (events, [[race condition]] free pulse events, arrays of events, reentrant [[mutex]]es, deadlock-free arrays of [[mutex]]es);
* pseudo-random non-repeating numbers, symmetric encoding and decoding;
* Portable IEEE 754 representations support.

The library is portable, distributed under GM [[GPL]], and compatible with [[Ada 95]] and [[Ada 2005]]. The library can be downloaded at its [http://www.dmitry-kazakov.de/ada/components.htm home page]
