Why exactly 7500? I think, since this is not about conditionals, that it's pretty useless to ask for a specific number. --[[User:Ben m|Ben m]] 16:57, 28 January 2007 (EST)
:I believe that's just to show that it must use numbers larger than 16 bits.  75000 is slightly above 65535. --[[User:Bob9000|Bob9000]] 16:28, 28 January 2007 (EST)
::That was the motivation when I created the article, yes. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 19:42, 28 January 2007 (EST)

== VB dialect? ==

Which variation of VB is demonstrated, anyhow?  That needs clarification.--[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 19:13, 29 January 2007 (EST)

== Split? ==

Should we split this task into console and GUI like we did for user input? This one isn't nearly as crowded, but it'd be nice if all of the tasks had languages as the main items on their TOC. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 08:39, 29 February 2008 (MST)

:Yes, I think it would be clearer to have two separate pages. But it would be good idea to have a link from one page to another ("See also..."). (And the same in User Output pages, too.)

Agree with the split. --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 14:27, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

Done. It's only a few clicks to bring it back if anyone complains. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 00:59, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
