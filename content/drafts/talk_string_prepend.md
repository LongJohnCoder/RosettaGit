==Haskell: No variable?==
I'm afraid the current Haskell example (`putStrLn ("Hello" ++ "World")`) misses the point: it shows how to append one string onto another and print the result, not how to assign a variable and update it by prepending a string.
: You are right! I guess functional languages don't go much for mutable state, but that is what the task requires...
