{{#set:is contribution page=true}}All pages listed on this page contain listings of programming problems one may attempt in a language, but haven't yet been solved on Rosetta Code.

Find a language you like or want to learn, and see if there are any problems you can solve that don't have shown solutions.  There are a variety of reasons why...

* You might do it in order to push the status of your favored language
* You might do it because there's a language you'd like to start learning
* You might do it because you're bored.

Whatever the reason, whatever the language, whatever your desired level of challenge, there's probably something there for you.

Of course, if you prefer, you can see [[:Category:Solutions by Programming Language|which languages ''have'' existing examples for various tasks]].
