"Editor" in general is any program that can create/change data, as opposed to "Viewers", which can only display.

This category is about Text Editors, for working with "plain text", as opposed to "Word Processors", which handle documents with text-styles, fonts, embedded pictures etc.

A [[wp:Text_editor|text editor]] is a program for editing plain text files, such as source code for programs and scripts.

There are other types of editors, specializing for certain kinds of data, 
eg. HTML-editors, etc.
