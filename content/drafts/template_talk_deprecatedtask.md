==Odd Phrasing?==
The text “This is not a common event.” looks really odd when it appears on the deprecated task's page; it matters not to the reader of the page whether the deprecation is common or rare. It instead belongs as a <code><nowiki><noinclude></nowiki></code> piece of text on the template page. –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 09:24, 9 December 2009 (UTC)
