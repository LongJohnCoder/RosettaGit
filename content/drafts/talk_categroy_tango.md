I didn't fix this page correctly. I'm not sure how it's supposed to go. Should we move this to a category page and then put <nowiki>{{library}}</nowiki> on that? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:14, 9 February 2008 (MST)
: It should be deleted; Nothing links here, nothing uses Tango, and there don't appear to be any pages on the wiki that reference it.  Remind me tomorrow. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 23:12, 9 February 2008 (MST)
:: I take it back.  Reading further through the changelog, there's an example that uses Tango that hasn't been index by Google yet. (Hence I didn't find it in a search.) It should be redirected to a category page.--[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 23:14, 9 February 2008 (MST)
