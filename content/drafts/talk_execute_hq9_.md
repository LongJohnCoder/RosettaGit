==HQ9+ language specifications==
Since the "language" of HQ9+ isn't that long, why not just post the specifications (in the "task" part) ? 

[Especially considering how often links seem to be broken.]


::  H: display "hello, world"
::  Q: display the program's source code (a quine).
::  9: display the lyrics to song "99 Bottles of Beer"
::  +: increments the accumulator
Note that the  "H"  message isn't capitalized nor punctuated.

Another web site has "H" as  "Hello, world!"

So, perhaps the monitor could make a call on "H" code.
