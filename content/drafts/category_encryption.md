[[Category:Solutions by Programming Task]]
[[Category:Mathematical operations]] [[Category:String manipulation]]

Tasks in this category have to do with data encryption (or decryption) using various algorithms.

Note that encryption is not the same as a [[:Category:Checksums|checksum]]. 

With encryption, the derived data carries an encrypted form of the original data, and can be manipulated to recreate the original input. 

A checksum is simply a sequence of characters 
(usually just a few characters in length) 
that cannot be converted back to the original form 
(because more than one input can have the same checksum).
