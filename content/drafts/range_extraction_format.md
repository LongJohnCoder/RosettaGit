<noinclude>'''This is used in [[Range extraction]] and [[Range expansion]].'''

</noinclude>A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either 
* individual integers
* Or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. (The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints)
:* '''The range syntax is to be used only for, and for every range that expands to more than two values.'''

'''Example'''

The list of integers:
: -6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20
Is accurately expressed by the range expression:
: -6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20
(And vice-versa).
