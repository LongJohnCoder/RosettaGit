This should be merged into [[:Category:X86 Assembly|X86 Assembly]] as it's the same and there are more examples filled.

: This category seems to be for 16-bit X86 code. I would like to have 16-bit X86 code in [[:Category:8086 Assembly]], 32-bit X86 code in [[:Category:80386 Assembly]], and 64-bit X86 code in (future) Category:AMD64 Assembly. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:21, 30 August 2011 (UTC)
