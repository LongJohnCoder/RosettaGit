{{library}}
JavaFX is a new software development kit for the Java platform.

It includes its own general-purpose programming language, [[JavaFX Script]], and a class library focused on GUI construction.

JavaFX programs run on a Java 6 SE JVM, and also on certain Java ME environments. The JavaFX library is divided in ''profiles'': the '''Common''' profile (for all environments), the '''Desktop''' profile (for desktop client applications), and the '''Mobile''' profile (for smart phones and other mobile devices).
