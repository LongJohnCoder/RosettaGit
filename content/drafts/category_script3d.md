}}'''Script3D''' (S3D) is a programming language for 3D applications adopted in the [http://www.vrmedia.it XVR] Virtual Reality Framework. It is an object oriented language with some specific features for 3D computations. 

This language has been designed by Scuola Superiore S.Anna in Pisa, Italy, and is used for a variety of virtual reality applications, mostly in Europe. It is taught in some introductory university courses for virtual reality applications.

The language is typically compiled to [[bytecode]] and executed by the XVR Virtual Machine inside a Web Browser or as a standalone application.
