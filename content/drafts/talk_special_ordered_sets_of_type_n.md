== Duplicate? ==

After all the really complicated explanation that probably needs to be cleaned up if this is to become a task, it sounds a lot like [[Greatest subsequential sum]]. Is this a duplicate? Or at least too close to add value? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:23, 25 January 2012 (UTC)

:I can see how you might think that. My title is much better of course, and has a wiki link.

::If it is the same idea then I would suggest trying to get the existing task changed rather than make a whole new one, since there are already a lot of examples there. If the other task needs more information then bring it up on [[Talk:Greatest subsequential sum|its talk page]]. We can rename that task and add WP links easily, but we need to agree on the name and the task content. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 15:16, 26 January 2012 (UTC)

::: They are quite not the same thing, though reading the WP article sheds no light on it: it's so badly written that if you are not familiar with linear programming, you can hardly know what it's talking about.  SOS are special solution vectors, in this case likely a vector of "yes" or "no" components regarding if relevant variables are chosen or not; greatest subseq sum can be done as an application of it if you go this route. [http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/SOS.htm This] does a better job explaining the concept behind SOS (it's listed above the WP article in a google search for "special ordered set", for a good reason probably). --[[User:Ledrug|Ledrug]] 16:23, 26 January 2012 (UTC)

==Candidate for deletion?==
This page has not received enough attention over the last 18 months. I suggest it be deleted in a weeks time? --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 04:29, 7 July 2013 (UTC)
