This template and [[Template:Programming-example-page]] were used in a similar manner, I have made all pages that used this template use [[Template:Programming-example-page]], mainly because it worked and this template did not appear to. Hence this template has become redundant. Can it be deleted? [[User:Op47|Op47]] 15:43, 30 March 2013 (UTC)
:I think this one was created back when we were thinking about doing some serious SMW work on the site. We might want to keep it in case that starts back up again. I don't think we have a template problem here. Not sure why all this effort is going into them right now. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:51, 30 March 2013 (UTC)
