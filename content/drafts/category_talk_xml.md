== Language? ==

Are we really considering this a language? I know the "L" means language, but it seems weird. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 01:49, 28 July 2011 (UTC)

If you look closely, the template I used was the ''np language'', not the ''language''. So, it seems like that if np language is used for HTML and such, this works. Because it is a computer language, but I don't think it's programming, so np language should be appropriate. [[User:Star651|Star651]] 19:04, 28 July 2011 (UTC)
:I didn't notice that. Sorry. Disregard this. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 19:07, 28 July 2011 (UTC)
