This task looks exceptionally similar to [[Call foreign language function]]. '''Propose merge.''' —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 11:56, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
: I agree. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 16:20, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
:: As the descriptions are written, they both link to C libraries. I concur.  (Though I wouldn't mind seeing a many-many task set.) --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 20:37, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
::: Moved, and set this page to be a redirect (it's the less-informative title after all, unless you happen to really know the jargon). The others can be expanded into a set of informative pages if you wish. --[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 20:44, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
:::: When importing the content you forgot to make the attribution, how can we correct this? [[User:Blue Prawn|Blue Prawn]] 22:10, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
::::: It's a wiki. You work it out… (I'm not doing it because I don't think there's a need to attribute the content of the task to its former location. If you meant a different type of attribution, you'll have to explain more.) —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 10:26, 18 August 2009 (UTC)
:::::: if you copy-past content which you are not the author, it would be fine to tell who is the original author in the summary log field,
:::::: I have made a no-op to add such a log in the history page: [http://rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Call_foreign_language_function&action=history]
::::::: Where there's a wiki, there's a way. :-) My goal is the readability of the resulting page, not the building up of a grand set of attributed examples. —[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 09:05, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
