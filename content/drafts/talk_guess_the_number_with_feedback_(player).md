==C code, -Wall, and end of main()==
Hitting "Y" is not the only way to end main().  Try ctrl-D, and your program will exit with code 255 (or whatever eof is).  Generally, using scanf() for interactive input is a bad idea, just so you know.  --[[User:Ledrug|Ledrug]] 21:57, 28 June 2011 (UTC)

== REXX solution ==

changing Upper info to info=translate(info) makes it work for all Rexxes I know
