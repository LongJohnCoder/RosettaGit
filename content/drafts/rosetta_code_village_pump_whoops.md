Dear Sir;

I added a radix sort page by clicking  Radix sort  on the http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Compare_sorting_algorithms'_performance
page.  http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Radix_sort isn't linked with the
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithms as it should be.

I hope you can fix this error.

Thank you with apologies,
Dave.
