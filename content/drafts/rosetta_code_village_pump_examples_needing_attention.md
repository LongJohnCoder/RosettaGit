Are folks still using the various "<language> examples needing attention" pages? Today, a whole bunch of new ones were created as orphans, so they don't show up from the main [[:Category:Examples needing attention]]. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 20:46, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
:I was trying to keep up with those edits today. I think someone had a bot do it. It looked like they were creating the pages based on broken links. I didn't think anyone used those pages either, so I didn't fix the edits to them. I don't use them, but it may be best to ask Short Circuit before we change the way they work. For now I guess we should put the enaheader's on? --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 21:44, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
