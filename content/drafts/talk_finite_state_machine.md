==Comment on task description==
HI, Welcome to task writing on RC!

I took a look at your task description and the Wikipedia page. It seems (to me), that the task description contains too much that is not explained, remember, RC example writers might be good in their programming language, but you might get more and better response if you further defined ''implicit'' and ''explicit'' and actually gave a more language independent description of the vending machine example in the task description.

I also made this a draft task. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 06:43, 24 August 2017 (UTC)

:Right, documentation isn't exactly my strong suit! I'll work on it though. Thanks! [[User:Magnus|Magnus]] ([[User talk:Magnus|talk]]) 19:32, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
