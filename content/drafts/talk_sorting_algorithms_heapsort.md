== WP markup reference problem ==
The wikipedia markup tag creates an article reference that creates a new article and doesn't reference the actual article.  Not sure how to fix. --[[User:Dgamey|Dgamey]] 14:36, 12 September 2010 (UTC)
:In all three cases you've mentioned this, the link syntax <nowiki>[[wp:pagename|pagename]]</nowiki> seems to create a working link for me. For example, <nowiki>[[wp:heapsort|heapsort]]</nowiki> creates link [[wp:heapsort|heapsort]], which as I check preview, links to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heapsort http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heapsort], which exists. Where does the link point for you? --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 15:08, 12 September 2010 (UTC)
:: He's (probably) referring to the link inside the wikipedia box. The issue is that the box was added when the page was called just “Heapsort”, so the auto-link creation worked then, but after the rename of this page into its systematic form it no longer works. I think this is fixable by adding a suitable parameter to the <nowiki>{{wikipedia}}</nowiki> template use. (I think I fixed this on another page already…) –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:23, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
