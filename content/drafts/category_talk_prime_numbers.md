==adding to list==

How does one add a Rosetta Task to this list?

Namely, "[[Counting in Factors]]". -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 20:37, 26 October 2013 (UTC)

: Adding things to a category: you put <tt><nowiki>[[Category:Prime Numbers]]</nowiki></tt> on the page. MediaWiki does the rest. Note that it normally doesn't show up where you add the link (MW reorganises that to the bottom of the page) and that the {{tmpl|task}} template has an optional argument which is a category to put the page in (as well as the ones for all tasks).
: And I've already fixed that page properly. ☺ –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 08:18, 27 October 2013 (UTC)
