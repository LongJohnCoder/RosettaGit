It seems redundant to duplicate the [[First-class functions]] code here. --[[User:Glennj|glennj]] 17:37, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
:Maybe, but it depends on how you want to make your comparison. I note that some have just put a link to FcF; it would be nice to make their own comments too, as i would like the page to show a comparison rather than leave the comparison ''wholly'' to the reader. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 18:28, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

==Whats's the Point?==
What is the point of this exercise? This doesn't really demonstrate anything interesting about a language's handling of numbers or functions, and it isn't related to a real-world task. --[[User:Psly4mne|Psly4mne]] 19:04, 6 December 2009 (UTC)

I stumbled upon this page, while looking for Algol-68 code using first-class function, and was quite puzzled by the numerous pink boxes stating the code example is incorrect and has to be fixed, although there seems to be nothing wrong with the code. I would have expected to find some sort of explanation of these boxes here, as to what exactly is perceived to be wrong, but none was found. Like [[User:Psly4mne|Psly4mne]] I don't quite see the point in this page. Could someone please explain what is going on here? --[[User:Lasse Hillerøe Petersen|Lasse Hillerøe Petersen]] ([[User talk:Lasse Hillerøe Petersen|talk]]) 21:15, 24 September 2014 (UTC)
:In the pink box it says they have failed to compare and contrast, as mentioned in the task description. Unfortunately, the template states fix the code, but in this case it should be fix the language example. You can also compare that example with others to also show what it lacks. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 21:47, 24 September 2014 (UTC)
