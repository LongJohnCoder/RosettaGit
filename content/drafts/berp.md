{{implementation|Python}}

Berp is an implementation of Python 3. At its heart is a translator, which takes [[Python]] code as input and generates [[Haskell]] code as output. The Haskell code is fed into a Haskell compiler ([[GHC]]) for compilation to machine code or interpretation as byte code.

Berp provides both a compiler and an interactive interpreter. For the most part it can be used in the same way as [[CPython]] (the main Python implementation).
