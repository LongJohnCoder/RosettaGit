==Non-English examples==
Protium has French and Chinese. I thought the site was an English language site? if other languages are OK in this case, then shouldn't there be a comment as to why it is OK in the example? (I know this may sound terribly anti other languages, but I thought that, unlike Wikipedia where it has separate "sub-sites" for each language, this was not so at RC). --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]]
