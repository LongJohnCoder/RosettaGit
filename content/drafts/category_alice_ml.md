Alice ML is a functional programming language based on [[Standard ML]], With ideas from [[Oz]]. It has rich support for concurrent, distributed, and constraint programming. Alice ML extends [[Standard ML]] with laziness, light-weight concurrency with implicit data-flow synchronisation, higher-order functors and abstract signatures, Packages, Pickling, type-safe cross-platform remote functions and network mobility & Constraints. It also has a lot of similarities to [[Erlang]].
