== Changes to Python example ==

I don't think removal of the comment "#1..10" is a good response to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzUTIffsc-M TimToady's language critique] (at the 2:51 mark). It makes what's going on ''less'' clear. The <math>[A..B)</math> means of describing lists is also shown in C++ where we use collection.begin() for <math>[A</math>, and collection.end() for <math>B)</math>. In the Python example's presentation case, it might help to use more descriptive text, and possibly link to the python docs for range(). --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 15:37, 12 March 2011 (UTC)


==Formula made invisible to most browsers by under-tested cosmetic edit at 16:00, 15 April 2016 ==

Under-tested cosmetic edits made to the task page at 16:00, 15 April 2016, including the injection of spaces around expressions in &lt;math&gt; tags, made the task description formula completely invisible to all browsers which display the graphic file version of formulae rather than processing the MathML (this is, in fact, the majority of browsers). The MediaWiki processor does not currently expect such spaces, and generates syntactically ill-formed HTML if they are introduced. Other aspects of these cosmetic edits may further compound the problem. [[User:Hout|Hout]] ([[User talk:Hout|talk]]) 10:27, 24 September 2016 (UTC)
