[[Category:Encyclopedia]]'''Real-time''' computing describes problems with hard time constraints, where a computation is considered to have failed not just if it gives the wrong results, but also if it obtains those results outside of specified time bounds. A real-time system as a whole often is required to have ''fast'' operation as well as ''predictable'' behavior.
