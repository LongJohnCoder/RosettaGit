### =MATLAB Solution=

I added the MATLAB solution, but when I did it my computer wasn't logged in. Sometimes my network connection drops, I have no idea why. Any who, the current revision says it was created by 169.236.149.86, is there a way to change that to Cferri?


### = CL solver =

There's a nice CL sudoku [http://common-lisp.net/project/computed-class/sudoku-source.html solver] using constraint propagation written by the [http://www.cliki.net/cl-dwim CL-DWIM] crew.

== C'mon ==

There's a bunch of sections on this page that are just links to external code. That kinda defeats the purpose of this site. The code should be on here so people can improve and comment on it. --[[Special:Contributions/164.67.235.138|164.67.235.138]] 04:49, 12 October 2009 (UTC)

== How partially filled-in? ==
The task description says "partially filled-in". Does that make it ok to restrict the program to 9x9 Sudoku grids that can be solved without guessing? [[User:bengt]] Mon Dec  9 12:20:24 CET 2013

== Long examples ==
You might consider creating sub-pages for long examples and moving current long entries to athe sub page. See [[Sudoku#version_1|REXX version 1]] for an example of how to do this. (See [[Sudoku#version_3|REXX version 3]] for an example that maybe should be moved to that sub page as well). --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 14:40, 3 October 2014 (UTC)
