This is a poor candidate for a task, as it depends too much on the capabilities of the environment. (Crudely, writing a non-ASCII character is pretty much trivial as soon as I/O is supported by the language at all, but what that displays as depends on what the terminal does.) â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 11:49, 25 November 2010 (UTC)

Unicode, other extended character sets, and localization in general are facts of life in this modern global era. I think it would be a fine task.  Even better would be to show how to choose the output character set, if applicable. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 19:08, 30 November 2010 (UTC)
