{{dead category}}
This category would have contained tasks with less than 5 examples.

There are no pages in this category. For a long time, this category had only 2 tasks, and both had at least 5 examples, but we forgot to remove both from this category. There is no need for this category, because tasks will eventually reach 5 examples as contributors add more languages.

For tasks with few examples, try [[:Category:Draft Programming Tasks]].
