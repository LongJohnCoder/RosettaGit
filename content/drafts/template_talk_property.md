I don't know that I've tagged all the current properties with this template yet. If I've missed any, please help out by adding <tt><nowiki>{{property}}</nowiki></tt> to the page where it's required. That will ensure that the page also goes into [[:Category:Property]] too. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 18:46, 29 August 2010 (UTC)
