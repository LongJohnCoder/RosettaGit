Shouldn't this page and [[Special characters]] be related in some way? Maybe make them into one page? [[User:DirkT|Dirk Thierbach]] 16 November 2007

== Bug report ==

Looks like Rosetta Code code colorer doesn't recognize D's delimiter strings. --[[User:Naryl|Naryl]] 12:53, 29 April 2008 (MDT)
: I'll get in and fix it when I get the chance. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 00:59, 2 May 2008 (MDT)
:: Thanks. You can find the specification [http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/lex.html#StringLiteral here]. Search for "Delimited Strings" --[[User:Naryl|Naryl]] 17:10, 4 May 2008 (MDT)
:: Also I noticed that 'scope' is not being highlighted as a keyword: [[Classes#D]] --[[User:Naryl|Naryl]] 07:15, 5 May 2008 (MDT)
