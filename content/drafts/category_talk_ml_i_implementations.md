Implementations categories are not intended to be textual lists, but rather a listing of pages ''on Rosetta Code'' that talk about specific implementations. That's not to say an offsite link to a larger list is inappropriate; I'm just pointing out that the 'too many to list here' indicates a misunderstanding of the role of the page. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 18:10, 12 August 2011 (UTC)
