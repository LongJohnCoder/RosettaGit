{{IDE}}
'''Emacs''' is a set of text editors controlled by [[Emacs Lisp]]. 
The two main types of Emacs are GNU Emacs and XEmacs. 
Usually, people just call them "Emacs". 

Gnu Emacs calls itself an "extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor." 

Features of both forms of Emacs include syntax highlighting for a variety of [[programming language|programming languages]], easy movement through documents, and keyboard macros. 

Plugins and [[libraries]] can be used in conjunction with emacs to make it do more interesting things like diffs, play text games, and view email.
