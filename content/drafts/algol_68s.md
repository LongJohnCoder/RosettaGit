'''The ALGOL 68S System''' written by [[wp:Charles_H._Lindsey|C.H. Lindsey]] using the [[wp:Amsterdam_Compiler_Kit|Amsterdam Compiler Kit]].  Current version is v2.4.

The system runs on the following systems.
* sun3 under OS4.x - v2.3
* sparc under OS4.x - v2.4
* sparc under OS5.x (Solaris 2.x) v2.4
* Atari under Gemdos - v2.3
* Acorn Archimedes under Riscos v2.4

The ALGOL 68 program gets the extension ".8", eg to compile type:
        a68s -c.e progname.8

The original system was developed for a [[wp:CDC 6000 series|CDC]] computer, then ported to [[wp:PERQ|PERQ]]s running [[wp:PNX|PNX]].  This also means that there are other [[ALGOL 68S]] compilers descended from the same stock.
