[[Category:Encyclopedia]]
'''Task''' is a subject of scheduling, usually owning other system resources. Operating systems ([[OS]]) supporting multiple tasks are called '''multitasking'''. Modern OS may have several types of tasks: [[process]], [[thread]], fiber. For a language supporting concurrency there are multiple options to map language defined tasks:
* mapping to the OS scheduling items, like a process or more often a thread;
* using own scheduler within single OS task;
* own scheduler without OS support, bare board, common for [[real-time computing|real-time]] embedded systems.
