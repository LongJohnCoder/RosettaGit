==PHP==

There are literally 10 different array sorting functions, however I touched on only those that were most commonly used.  I can add more examples, but I think it would get quite long. [[User:Zeryl|Zeryl]] 02:47, 24 January 2007 (EST)

== Scope creep ==

These examples are trying to do too much.  This shouldn't be a list of every possible sorting operation in each language; it should be a set of implementations of a single, specific task.  And since the page is named simply "Sorting", I think that task should be something like "Sort an array of integers (or generic objects if possible) in natural order."  (I'm contradicting myself here a bit, but it would be good to have basic integer sorting, optionally followed by sorting generic objects in natural order...and nothing more.)

The task described at the top, and implemented by the original example, is a nice instance of a more unusual sorting task.  It should be split to its own page with a more specific name.

:Agreed.  Would you mind adding a bit about Scope Creep to the [[Help:Adding_a_new_programming_task|Guidelines]] for creating tasks?

:This page should become a discussion page, with links to tasks for different sorting methods. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 11:26, 26 January 2007 (EST)
