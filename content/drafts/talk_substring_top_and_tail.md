==Duplicate task?==

This appears to be the same task as done by [[Substring]]… –[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] 08:48, 6 June 2011 (UTC)

:Substring does not cover first character removal, and initial consensus that the task is too far into development to add requirements. It is probably better to split this into sub tasks anyway, because there are several different substring methods which have not been included on that task. --[[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 11:30, 6 June 2011 (UTC)

==possible errors==

It seems that several examples will fail when the original string is null (length zero) or only a single character.  I don't know that much about BIFs (built-in-functions) for the many languages, so I can only speak for a small number of them. -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] 05:23, 12 May 2012 (UTC)

Are the computer programming examples supposed to work with a string of zero length (a null string) as well as a one-character string?   -- [[User:Gerard Schildberger|Gerard Schildberger]] ([[User talk:Gerard Schildberger|talk]]) 22:05, 30 June 2015 (UTC)

== A little over the top in the Swift-section? ==


In the Swift-section I wrote an answer, and a few days later [[User:Hooman]], extended the answer and included loads of stuff related to how Swift can handle multiple types using the same methods. I, as a novice programmer in Swift, learned stuff, but isn't this somewhat off topic for this page? How do you suggest handling/correcting it to a shorter more precise answer? --[[User:Holroy|Holroy]] ([[User talk:Holroy|talk]]) 18:04, 5 March 2015 (UTC)

OK, I will remove the examples for generic functions. Also, note my changes to your extension of String. --[[User:Hooman|Hooman]] ([[User talk:Hooman|talk]]) 21:40, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
