Could it be noted on here how often these lists will update? We don't need people thinking that these are the current states of all the languages. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 21:22, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

SQL Derivatives and Esoteric Languages need to be taken out of this list. I guess there's no nice way of doing that. It looks like that would have to be hard coded into the bot since they don't look any different than any other programming language. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 00:09, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
:You could create a list with only the languages that have attempted more than X% of the tasks. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 04:32, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

The link to [[Tasks not implemented in C++]] actually leads to [[Tasks not implemented in C]]. --[[User:Ce|Ce]] 07:51, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
: Yeah. The switch to FCGI broke it.  I'll get it fixed as soon ASAP, believe me.  But work is ''insane'' right now. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 10:27, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

:: Maybe a link from [[Tasks not implemented in C]] to [[Tasks not implemented in C++]], similar to the one from [[:Category:C]] to [[:Category:C++]] would be a good idea. However I don't know if this would survive bot changes or even confuse the bot. --[[User:Ce|Ce]] 07:36, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
::: It wouldn't confuse the bot; The bot overwrites the whole page if it needs to.  However, since we're using templates for the page sections, I don't think it will ever rewrite a language's "Tasks not implemented in X" page, so long as it's included in this category. Add the link; I don't think it will be a problem.  --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 12:56, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

:::: According to the [http://www.rosettacode.org/w/index.php?title=Tasks_not_implemented_in_C&action=history page history], the bot does overwrite the "Tasks not implemented in X" page. So I conclude that link wouldn't stay very long. However the included [[Template:Unimpl header]] appears to be unmodified by the bot. With the help of ParserFunctions it should be possible to add the link only for the C page. I'll try that. --[[User:Ce|Ce]] 07:46, 24 April 2009 (UTC)
:::: Works! --[[User:Ce|Ce]] 08:05, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

I'm puzzled: why is there a single entry for "Reduce" under "Subcategories", which to me looks rather like an entry for an ordinary language "Reduce" that could go in its place amongst all the others? And I've lost the link that gave statistics as to implementations via various languages. I'm sure I saw it somewhere...

: The [[Template:unimpl_Page]] was misplaced. It should be on its on page.
: There are the tasks [[Rosetta Code/Count examples]] and [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity]]. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 16:44, 7 February 2016 (UTC)
::Ah, I see that the "Reduce" entry has vanished, but, the history for the category page shows no change since November 2010. Clearly, the table content is updated more recently by some process but the surrounding information comes from somewhere else. Possibly, the update of the table information results in the rewriting of the entire page, so that the "page source" from which Firefox generates the display is not itself the original source. As I am unfamiliar with the workings of this system, I often see effects but can't find the causes so I can't even attempt to fix any problems. And thanks for locating the language statistics; it appears that updates there occur when another contributor has a go, though the RC_POP.OUT might be updated monthly. There will be a delay before I attempt a furrytran assault. [[User:Dinosaur|Dinosaur]] ([[User talk:Dinosaur|talk]]) 01:05, 8 February 2016 (UTC)
